This is a <em>catena aurea</em> (golden chain) for <em>A Course in Miracles</em>.

The course text is supplied in alternative renderings which substitute pronouns.

This is done to help clarify some confusing paragraphs. It is not an attempt to render it easier to read, but rather to provide an aid to study.

Substituting pronouns replaces Him and He, thus de-gendering God, but this was NOT the point of the exercise.

I also try to clarify the adverbial ‘but’. I find this annoying and confusing.

I have provided a summary for each paragraph. The summary is my own. I do not claim these summaries are in any way ‘scribed’ or ‘channelled’ or even ‘inspired’, but I did at times need to ask for guidance.

I have also provided excerpts from well known course commentators. This is the Golden Chain.

Yes, I changed some of the spelling and punctuation to reflect a more ‘British’ orientation. Some personal prejudices are also reflected thereby. If you believe this is wrong, you can let me know why. Maybe I’ll change my mind.

I very much welcome correspondence with suggestions for improvements or additions.

The site is built with static site generator Jekyll and the <a href=https://github.com/W-David-Porter/acim>sources are in github</a>. 

I'm thinking of porting it to vuepress instead. 

If you don't know what github is, you can <a href=mailto:acim@fea.st>email me</a> instead. 

Help with CSS and site design would be appreciated also.
