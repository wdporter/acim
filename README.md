- title: Text
  details: This is a course in miracles. It is a required course. Only the time you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.
- title: Workbook for Students
  details: A theoretical foundation, such as the text, is necessary as a background to make these exercises meaningful. Yet it is the exercises that will make the goal possible. An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. It is the purpose of these exercises to train the mind to think along the lines which the course sets forth.
- title: Manual for Teachers
  details: The role of teaching and learning is actually reversed in the thinking of the world. The reversal is characteristic. It seems as if the teacher and the learner are separated, the teacher giving something to the learner rather than to himself. Further, the act of teaching is regarded as a special activity in which one engages only a relatively small proportion of one’s time. The course, on the other hand, emphasises that to teach is to learn, so that teacher and learner are the same. It also emphasises that teaching is a constant process; it goes on every moment of the day and continues into sleeping thoughts as well.

## A Course In Miracles — A Golden Chain

The course text is supplied in alternative renderings which substitute pronouns.

This is done to help clarify some confusing paragraphs. It is not an attempt to render it easier to read, but rather to provide an aid to study.

Substituting pronouns replaces Him and He, thus de-gendering God, but this was NOT the point of the exercise.

I also try to clarify the adverbial ‘but’. I find this annoying and confusing.

I have provided a summary for each paragraph. The summary is my own. I do not claim these summaries are in any way ‘scribed’ or ‘channelled’ or even ‘inspired’, but I did at times need to ask for guidance.

I have also provided excerpts from well known course commentators. This is the Golden Chain.

Yes, I changed some of the spelling and punctuation to reflect a more ‘British’ orientation. Some personal prejudices are also reflected thereby. If you believe this is wrong, you can let me know why. Maybe I’ll change my mind.

I very much welcome correspondence with suggestions for improvements or additions.

The site is built with static site generator Jekyll and the <a href=https://github.com/W-David-Porter/acim>sources are in github</a>. 

I'm thinking of porting it to vuepress instead. 

If you don't know what github is, you can <a href=mailto:acim@fea.st>email me</a> instead. 

Help with CSS and site design would be appreciated also.
