# I am never upset for the reason I think.

<a id=w-pi-5-1></a>1.&emsp;This idea, like the preceding one, can be used with any person, situation or event you think is causing you pain. ^2^Apply it specifically to whatever you believe is the cause of your upset, using the description of the feeling in whatever term seems accurate to you. ^3^The upset may seem to be fear, worry, depression, anxiety, anger, hatred, jealousy or any number of forms, all of which will be perceived as different. ^4^This is not true. ^5^However, until you learn that form does not matter, each form becomes a proper subject for the exercises for the day. ^6^Applying the same idea to each of them separately is the first step in ultimately recognising they are all the same.

::: tab Commentary
Through the dynamic of projection, the ego continually seeks to have us believe our problems are outside us in the world of the body — our own or others’. Thus we believe that what upsets us are problems perceived as external to us, beyound our control, for which we must find solutions. As long as we believe in the ego’s seductive smokescreens, the true source of the problem — our misthoughts — remains beyond recognition and therefore beyond correction. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.67)

^3^I am not angry at _____ for the reason I think.
