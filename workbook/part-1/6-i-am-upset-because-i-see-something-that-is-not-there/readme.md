# LESSON 6

# I am upset because I see something that is not there.

<a id=w-pi-6-1></a>1.&emsp;The exercises with this idea are very similar to the preceding ones. ^2^Again, it is necessary to name both the form of upset (anger, fear, worry, depression and so on) and the perceived source very specifically for any application of the idea. ^3^For example:

<div class="indent italic">

^4^I am angry at _____ because I see something that is not there.  
^5^I am worried about _____ because I see something that is not there.

</div>

<a id=w-pi-6.2></a>2.&emsp;Today’s idea is useful for application to anything that seems to upset you, and can profitably be used throughout the day for that purpose. ^2^However, the three or four practice periods which are required should be preceded by a minute or so of mind searching, as before, and the application of the idea to each upsetting thought uncovered in the search.

<div class="indented italic">

^2^There are no small upsets. ^3^They are all equally disturbing to my peace of mind.

</div>

<div class=centred>

^4^And:

</div>

<div class="indented italic">

^5^I cannot keep this form of upset and let the others go. ^6^For the purposes of these exercises, then, I will regard them all as the same.
