# LESSON 10

# My thoughts do not mean anything

<a name=w-pi-10-1></a>1.&emsp;This idea applies to all the thoughts of which you are aware, or become aware in the practice periods. ^2^The reason the idea is applicable to all of them is that they are not your real thoughts. ^3^We have made this distinction before, and will do so again. ^4^You have no basis for comparison as yet. ^5^When you do, you will have no doubt that what you once believed were your thoughts did not mean anything.

<a name=w-pi-10-2></a>2.&emsp;This is the second time we have used this kind of idea. ^2^The form is only slightly different. ^3^This time the idea is introduced with “My thoughts” instead of “These thoughts”, and no link is made overtly with the things around you. ^4^The emphasis is now on the lack of reality of what you think you think.

<a name=w-pi-10-3></a>3.&emsp;This aspect of the correction process began with the idea that the thoughts of which you are aware are meaningless, outside rather than within; and then stressed their past rather than their present status. ^2^Now we are emphasising that the presence of these ‘thoughts’ means that you are not thinking. ^3^This is merely another way of repeating our earlier statement that your mind is really a blank. ^4^To recognise this is to recognise nothingness when you think you see it. ^5^As such, it is the prerequisite for vision.

Past thoughts are not real thoughts. Past thoughts indicate a blank mind. Seeing a blank mind for what it is is the prerequisite for seeing what really is.

<a name=w-pi-10-4></a>4.&emsp;Close your eyes for these exercises, and introduce them by repeating the idea for today quite slowly to yourself. ^2^Then add:

<div class="indented italic">

^3^This idea will help to release me from all that I now believe.

</div>

^4^The exercises consist, as before, in searching your mind for all the thoughts that are available to you, without selection or judgement. ^5^Try to avoid classification of any kind. ^6^In fact, if you find it helpful to do so, you might imagine that you are watching an oddly assorted procession going by, which has little if any personal meaning to you. ^7^As each one crosses your mind, say:

<div class="indented italic">

^8^My thought about _____ does not mean anything.  
^9^My thought about _____ does not mean anything.

</div>

<a name=w-pi-10-5></a>5.&emsp;Today’s thought can obviously serve for any thought that distresses you at any time. ^2^In addition, five practice periods are recommended, each involving no more than a minute or so of mind searching. ^3^It is not recommended that this time period be extended, and it should be reduced to half a minute or less if you experience discomfort. ^4^Remember, however, to repeat the idea slowly before applying it specifically, and also to add:

<div class="indented italic">

^5^This idea will help to release me from all that I now believe

</div>
