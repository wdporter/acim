1.&emsp;Now look slowly around you, and practice applying this idea very specifically to whatever you see:

<div class="indented italic">

^2^This table does not mean anything.  
^3^This chair does not mean anything.  
^4^This hand does not mean anything.  
^5^This foot does not mean anything.  
^6^This pen does not mean anything.

</div>

<a name="w-pi-1-2"></a>2.&emsp;Then look farther away from your immediate area, and apply the idea to a wider range:

<div class="indented italic">

^2^That door does not mean anything.  
^3^That body does not mean anything.  
^4^That lamp does not mean anything.  
^5^That sign does not mean anything.  
^6^That shadow does not mean anything.

</div>

(5) …rituals, as they are discussed in the Course, especially in the workbook which, given its structured exercises, *could* easily lend itself to ritual. Yet, it clearly cautions against such practices (Wapnick, L.D.N.C.,p.550, A.A.C.,p.274)

Lessons 1 to 3 are to be done twice a day. Morning and Evening. Keep it to about a minute. Take it easy.

::: tab Note
Keep the lesson to a minute — but you can go longer if you feel like you are hurrying up the lesson in order to keep it under a minute.
