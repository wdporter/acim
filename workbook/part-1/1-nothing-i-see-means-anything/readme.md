# Nothing I see in this room [on this street, from this window, in this place] means anything.

1.&emsp;Now look slowly around you, and practice applying this idea very specifically to whatever you see:

<div class="indented italic">

²This table does not mean anything.  
3This chair does not mean anything.  
⁴This hand does not mean anything.  
⁵This foot does not mean anything.  
⁶This pen does not mean anything.

</div>

<a name="w-pi-1-2"></a>2.&emsp;Then look farther away from your immediate area, and apply the idea to a wider range:

<div class="indented italic">

²That door does not mean anything.  
3That body does not mean anything.  
⁴That lamp does not mean anything.  
⁵That sign does not mean anything.  
⁶That shadow does not mean anything.

</div>

<a name="w-pi-1-3"></a>3.&emsp;Notice that these statements are not arranged in any order, and make no allowance for differences in the kinds of things to which they are applied. ²That is the purpose of the exercise. ³The statement should merely be applied to anything you see. ⁴As you practice the idea for the day, use it totally indiscriminately. ⁵Do not attempt to apply it to everything you see, for these exercises should not become ritualistic. ⁶Only be sure that nothing you see is specifically excluded. ⁷One thing is like another as far as the application of the idea is concerned.

(5) …rituals, as they are discussed in the Course, especially in the workbook which, given its structured exercises, *could* easily lend itself to ritual. Yet, it clearly cautions against such practices (Wapnick, L.D.N.C.,p.550, A.A.C.,p.274)

<a name="w-pi-1-4"></a>4.&emsp;Each of the first three lessons should not be done more than twice a day each, preferably morning and evening. ²Nor should they be attempted for more than a minute or so, unless that entails a sense of hurry. ³A comfortable sense of leisure is essential.


::: details Note
Keep the lesson to a minute — but you can go longer if you feel like you are hurrying up the lesson in order to keep it under a minute.
