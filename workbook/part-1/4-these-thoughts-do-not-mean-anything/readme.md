# LESSON 4

# These thoughts do not mean anything. They are like the things I see in this room [on this street, from this window, in this place].

<a id=w-pi-4-1></a>1.&emsp;Unlike the preceding ones, these exercises do not begin with the idea for the day. ^2^In these practice periods, begin with noting the thoughts that are crossing your mind for about a minute. ^3^Then apply the idea to them. ^4^If you are already aware of unhappy thoughts, use them as subjects for the idea. ^5^Do not, however, select only the thoughts you think are ‘bad’. ^6^You will find, if you train yourself to look at your thoughts, that they represent such a mixture that, in a sense, none of them can be called ‘good’ or ‘bad’. ^7^This is why they do not mean anything.

Unlike the preceding ones [exercises], these exercises do not begin with the idea for the day. ^2^In these practice periods, begin with noting the thoughts that are crossing your mind for about a minute. ^3^Then apply the idea to them [the thoughts that are crossing your mind]. ^4^If you are already aware of unhappy thoughts, use them [unhappy thoughts] as subjects for the idea. ^5^Do not, however, select only the thoughts you think are ‘bad’. ^6^You will find, if you train yourself to look at your thoughts, that they [your thoughts] represent such a mixture that, in a sense, none of them [your thoughts] can be called ‘good’ or ‘bad’. ^7^This is why they [your thoughts] do not mean anything.

All your thoughts are the same. Your thoughts are neither good or bad. Your thoughts do not mean anything.

<a id=w-pi-4-2></a>2.&emsp;In selecting the subjects for the application of today’s idea, the usual specificity is required. ^2^Do not be afraid to use ‘good’ thoughts as well as ‘bad’. ^3^None of them represents your real thoughts, which are being covered up by them. ^4^The ‘good’ ones are but shadows of what lies beyond, and shadows make sight difficult. ^5^The ‘bad’ ones are blocks to sight, and make seeing impossible. ^6^You do not want either.

Good thoughts are shadows of real thoughts. Bad thoughts are blocks to real thoughts. You want only real thoughts.

What is outside you is meaningless. Only what is inside you can be meaningful.

<a id=w-pi-4-4></a>4.&emsp;In using your thoughts for application of the idea for today, identify each thought by the central figure or event it contains; for example:

<div class="indent italic">

^2^This thought about ____ does not mean anything. ^3^It is like the things I see in this room [on this street, and so on].

<a id=w-pi-4-5></a>5.&emsp;You can also use the idea for a particular thought that you recognise as harmful. ^2^This practice is useful, but is not a substitute for the more random procedures to be followed for the exercises. ^3^Do not, however, examine your mind for more than a minute or so. ^4^You are too inexperienced as yet to avoid a tendency to become pointlessly preoccupied.

<a id=w-pi-4-6></a>6.&emsp;Further, since these exercises are the first of their kind, you may find the suspension of judgement in connection with thoughts particularly difficult. ^2^Do not repeat these exercises more than three or four times during the day. ^3^We will return to them later.
