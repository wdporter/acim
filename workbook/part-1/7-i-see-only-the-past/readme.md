# LESSON 7

# I see only the past.

<a name=w-pi-7-1></a>1.&emsp;This idea is particularly difficult to believe at first. ^2^Yet it is the rationale for all of the preceding ones.  
<span class=lineindent>^3^It</span> is the reason why nothing that you see means anything.  
<span class=lineindent>^4^It</span> is the reason why you have given everything you see all the meaning that it has for you.  
<span class=lineindent>^5^It</span> is the reason why you do not understand anything you see.  
<span class=lineindent>^6^It</span> is the reason why your thoughts do not mean anything, and why they are like the things you see.  
<span class=lineindent>^7^It</span> is the reason why you are never upset for the reason you think.  
<span class=lineindent>^8^It</span> is the reason why you are upset because you see something that is not there.

<a name=w-pi-7-2></a>2.&emsp;Old ideas about time are very difficult to change, because everything you believe is rooted in time, and depends on your not learning these new ideas about it. ^2^Yet that is precisely why you need new ideas about time. ^3^This first time idea is not really so strange as it may sound at first.

<a name=w-pi-7-4></a>4.&emsp;Look about you. ^2^This is equally true of whatever you look at. ^3^Acknowledge this by applying the idea for today indiscriminately to whatever catches your eye. ^4^For example:

<div class="indented italic">

^5^I see only the past in this pencil.  
^6^I see only the past in this shoe.  
^7^I see only the past in this hand.  
^8^I see only the past in that body.  
^9^I see only the past in that face.

</div>
