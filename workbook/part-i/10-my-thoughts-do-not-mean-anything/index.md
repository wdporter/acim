1. This idea applies to all the thoughts of which you are aware, or become aware in the practice periods. 
²The reason the idea is applicable to all of them is that they are not your real thoughts. 
³We have made this distinction before, and will do so again. 
⁴You have no basis for comparison as yet. 
⁵When you do, you will have no doubt that what you once believed were your thoughts did not mean anything.

This idea applies to all the thoughts of which [thoughts] you are aware, or become aware in the practice periods. 
²The reason the idea is applicable to all of them [thoughts] is that they [thoughts] are not your real thoughts. 
³We have made this distinction [between your thoughts and your real thoughts] before, and will do so [make the distinction between thoughts and real thoughts] again. 
⁴You have no basis for comparison as yet. 
⁵When you do [have a basis for comparison], you will have no doubt that what you once believed were your thoughts did not mean anything.

This idea applies to all the thoughts; the thoughts you are aware, or become aware in the practice periods.

You are not aware of your real thoughts yet.

2. This is the second time we have used this kind of idea. 
²The form is only slightly different. 
³This time the idea is introduced with “My thoughts” instead of “These thoughts”, and no link is made overtly with the things around you. 
⁴The emphasis is now on the lack of reality of what you think you think.

3. This aspect of the correction process began with the idea that the thoughts of which you are aware are meaningless, outside rather than within; and then stressed their past rather than their present status. 
²Now we are emphasising that the presence of these ‘thoughts’ means that you are not thinking. 
³This is merely another way of repeating our earlier statement that your mind is really a blank. 
⁴To recognise this is to recognise nothingness when you think you see it. 
⁵As such, it is the prerequisite for vision.

²Now we are emphasising that the presence of these ‘thoughts’ [past thoughts] means that you are not thinking. 
³This [thinking past thoughts means you are not thinking] is merely another way of repeating our earlier statement that your mind is really a blank. 
⁴To recognise this [your mind is really a blank] is to recognise nothingness when you think you see it [nothingness?]. 
⁵As such, it [recognising nothingness] is the prerequisite for vision.

##### Simplified

Past thoughts are not real thoughts. 
Past thoughts indicate a blank mind. 
Seeing a blank mind for what it is is the prerequisite for seeing what really is.

4. Close your eyes for these exercises, and introduce them by repeating the idea for today quite slowly to yourself. 
²Then add:

>³This idea will help to release me from all that I now believe.

⁴The exercises consist, as before, in searching your mind for all the thoughts that are available to you, without selection or judgement. 
⁵Try to avoid classification of any kind. 
⁶In fact, if you find it helpful to do so, you might imagine that you are watching an oddly assorted procession going by, which has little if any personal meaning to you. 
⁷As each one crosses your mind, say:

>⁸My thought about _____ does not mean anything.  
⁹My thought about _____ does not mean anything.

5. Today’s thought can obviously serve for any thought that distresses you at any time. 
²In addition, five practice periods are recommended, each involving no more than a minute or so of mind searching. 
³It is not recommended that this time period be extended, and it should be reduced to half a minute or less if you experience discomfort. 
⁴Remember, however, to repeat the idea slowly before applying it specifically, and also to add:

>⁵This idea will help to release me from all that I now believe
