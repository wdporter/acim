# LESSON 8

# My mind is preöccupied with past thoughts

<a name=w-pi-8-1></a>1. This idea is, of course, the reason why you see only the past. ²No one really sees anything. ³ He sees only his thoughts projected outward. ⁴The mind’s preoccupation with the past is the cause of the misconception about time from which your seeing suffers. ⁵Your mind cannot grasp the present, which is the only time there is. ⁶It therefore cannot understand time, and cannot, in fact, understand anything.

The present is the only time there is. Your mind sees only the past. If you see only the past, you cannot understand anything in the present.

Past/future does not exist. Your mind is blank when you think about past/future.

<a name=w-pi-8-4></a>4. The exercises for today should be done with eyes closed. ²This is because you actually cannot see anything, and it is easier to recognise that no matter how vividly you may picture a thought, you are not seeing anything. ³With as little investment as possible, search your mind for the usual minute or so, merely noting the thoughts you find there. ⁴Name each one by the central figure or theme it contains, and pass on to the next. ⁵Introduce the practice period by saying:

<div class="indented italic">

⁶I seem to be thinking about _____.

</div>

<a name=w-pi-8.5></a>5. Then name each of your thoughts specifically, for example:

<div class="indented italic">

²I seem to be thinking about [name of a person], about [name of an object], about [name of an emotion],

</div>

and so on, concluding at the end of the mind-searching period with:

<div class="indented italic">

3But my mind is preoccupied with past thoughts.

</div>

<a name=w-pi-8.6></a>6. This can be done four or five times during the day, unless you find it irritates you. ²If you find it trying, three or four times is sufficient. ³You might find it helpful, however, to include your irritation, or any emotion that the idea for today may induce, in the mind searching itself.
