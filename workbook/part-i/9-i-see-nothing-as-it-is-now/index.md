1. This idea obviously follows from the two preceding ones. 
²But while you may be able to accept it intellectually, it is unlikely that it will mean anything to you as yet. 
³However, understanding is not necessary at this point. 
⁴In fact, the recognition that you do not understand is a prerequisite for undoing your false ideas. 
⁵These exercises are concerned with practice, not with understanding. 
⁶You do not need to practice what you already understand. 
⁷It would indeed be circular to aim at understanding, and assume that you have it already.

##### Simpified

The training is for understanding. 
You do not understand yet.

2. It is difficult for the untrained mind to believe that what it seems to picture is not there. 
²This idea can be quite disturbing, and may meet with active resistance in any number of forms. 
³Yet that does not preclude applying it. 
⁴No more than that is required for these or any other exercises. 
⁵Each small step will clear a little of the darkness away, and understanding will finally come to lighten every corner of the mind that has been cleared of the debris that darkens it.

##### Simplified

Try to apply the idea regardless of how much resistance you meet. Each small step helps.

3. These exercises, for which three or four practice periods are sufficient, involve looking about you and applying the idea for the day to whatever you see, remembering the need for its indiscriminate application, and the essential rule of excluding nothing. 
²For example:

>³I do not see this typewriter as it is now.  
⁴I do not see this telephone as it is now.  
⁵I do not see this arm as it is now.

4. Begin with things that are nearest you, and then extend the range outward:

>²I do not see that coat rack as it is now.  
³I do not see that door as it is now.  
⁴I do not see that face as it is now.

5. It is emphasised again that while complete inclusion should not be attempted, specific exclusion must be avoided. 
²Be sure you are honest with yourself in making this distinction. 
³You may be tempted to obscure it.
