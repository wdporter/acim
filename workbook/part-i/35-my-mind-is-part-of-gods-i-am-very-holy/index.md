1. Today’s idea does not describe the way you see yourself now. 
²It does, however, describe what vision will show you. 
³It is difficult for anyone who thinks he is in this world to believe this of himself. 
⁴Yet the reason he thinks he is in this world is because he does not believe it.

Today’s idea does not describe the way you see yourself now. 
²It [today’s idea] does, however, describe what vision will show you. 
³It is difficult for anyone who thinks he [one] is in this world to believe [today’s idea] of himself [one’s self]. 
⁴Yet the reason he [one] thinks he [one] is in this world is because he [one] does not believe it [today’s idea].

³It is difficult for anyone who thinks one is in this world to believe today’s idea of one’s self. 
⁴Yet the reason one thinks one is in this world is because one does not believe today’s idea.

##### Simplified

You do not believe you are very holy, so you think you are in this world. 
Vision will show you that you are very holy.

2. You will believe that you are part of where you think you are. 
²That is because you surround yourself with the environment you want. 
³And you want it to protect the image of yourself that you have made. 
⁴The image is part of this environment. 
⁵What you see while you believe you are in it is seen through the eyes of the image. 
⁶This is not vision. 
⁷Images cannot see.

You create an environment to protect the image you have of yourself.
You see what you think you are.
You cannot have true vision through the image you have of yourself.

3. The idea for today presents a very different view of yourself. 
²By establishing your Source it establishes your Identity, and it describes you as you must really be in truth. 
³We will use a somewhat different kind of application for today's idea because the emphasis for today is on the perceiver, rather than on what he perceives.

You true identity is that your mind is part of God’s and that you are very holy.

4. For each of the three five-minute practice periods today, begin by repeating today’s idea to yourself, and then close your eyes and search your mind for the various kinds of descriptive terms in which you see yourself. 
²Include all the ego-based attributes which you ascribe to yourself, positive or negative, desirable or undesirable, grandiose or debased. 
³All of them are equally unreal, because you do not look upon yourself through the eyes of holiness.

5. In the earlier part of the mind-searching period, you will probably emphasise what you consider to be the more negative aspects of your perception of yourself. 
²Toward the latter part of the exercise period, however, more self-inflating descriptive terms may well cross your mind. 
³Try to recognise that the direction of your fantasies about yourself does not matter. 
⁴Illusions have no direction in reality. 
⁵They are merely not true.

6. A suitable unselected list for applying the idea for today might be as follows:

>²I see myself as imposed on.  
³I see myself as depressed.  
⁴I see myself as failing.  
⁵I see myself as endangered.  
⁶I see myself as helpless.  
⁷I see myself as victorious.  
⁸I see myself as losing out.  
⁹I see myself as charitable.  
¹⁰I see myself as virtuous.

7. You should not think of these terms in an abstract way. 
²They will occur to you as various situations, personalities and events in which you figure cross your mind. 
³Pick up any specific situation that occurs to you, identify the descriptive term or terms you feel are applicable to your reactions to that situation, and use them in applying today’s idea. 
⁴After you have named each one, add:

>⁵But my mind is part of God’s. 
⁶I am very holy.

8. During the longer exercise periods, there will probably be intervals in which nothing specific occurs to you. 
²Do not strain to think up specific things to fill the interval, but merely relax and repeat today’s idea slowly until something occurs to you. 
³Although nothing that does occur should be omitted from the exercises, nothing should be ‘dug out’ with effort. 
⁴Neither force nor discrimination should be used.

9. As often as possible during the day, pick up a specific attribute or attributes you are ascribing to yourself at the time and apply the idea for today to them, adding the idea in the form stated above to each of them. 
²If nothing particular occurs to you, merely repeat the idea to yourself, with closed eyes.
