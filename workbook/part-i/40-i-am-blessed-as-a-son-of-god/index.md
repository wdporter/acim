1. Today we will begin to assert some of the happy things to which you are entitled, being what you are. 
²No long practice periods are required today, but very frequent short ones are necessary. 
³Once every ten minutes would be highly desirable, and you are urged to attempt this schedule and to adhere to it whenever possible. 
⁴If you forget, try again. 
⁵If there are long interruptions, try again. 
⁶Whenever you remember, try again.

2. You need not close your eyes for the exercise periods, although you will probably find it more helpful if you do. 
²However, you may be in a number of situations during the day when closing your eyes would not be feasible. 
³Do not miss a practice period because of this. 
⁴You can practice quite well under any circumstances, if you really want to.

3. Today’s exercises take little time and no effort. 
²Repeat the idea for today, and then add several of the attributes you associate with being a Son of God, applying them to yourself. 
³One practice period might, for example, consist of the following:

>⁴I am blessed as a Son of God.  
⁵I am happy, peaceful, loving and contented.

⁶Another might take this form:

>⁷I am blessed as a Son of God.  
⁸I am calm, quiet, assured and confident.

⁹If only a brief period is available, merely telling yourself that you are blessed as a Son of God will do.
