# LESSON 7

# I see only the past.

<a name=w-pi-7-1></a>1. This idea is particularly difficult to believe at first. ²Yet it is the rationale for all of the preceding ones.  
<span class=lineindent>3It</span> is the reason why nothing that you see means anything.  
<span class=lineindent>⁴It</span> is the reason why you have given everything you see all the meaning that it has for you.  
<span class=lineindent>⁵It</span> is the reason why you do not understand anything you see.  
<span class=lineindent>⁶It</span> is the reason why your thoughts do not mean anything, and why they are like the things you see.  
<span class=lineindent>⁷It</span> is the reason why you are never upset for the reason you think.  
<span class=lineindent>⁸It</span> is the reason why you are upset because you see something that is not there.

<a name=w-pi-7-2></a>2. Old ideas about time are very difficult to change, because everything you believe is rooted in time, and depends on your not learning these new ideas about it. ²Yet that is precisely why you need new ideas about time. ³This first time idea is not really so strange as it may sound at first.

<a name=w-pi-7-4></a>4. Look about you. ²This is equally true of whatever you look at. ³Acknowledge this by applying the idea for today indiscriminately to whatever catches your eye. ⁴For example:

<div class="indented italic">

⁵I see only the past in this pencil.  
⁶I see only the past in this shoe.  
⁷I see only the past in this hand.  
⁸I see only the past in that body.  
⁹I see only the past in that face.

</div>
