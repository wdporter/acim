 ⁷It is the reason why you are never upset for the reason you think.  
 ⁸It is the reason why you are upset because you see something that is not there.

3. Look at a cup, for example. 
²Do you see a cup, or are you merely reviewing your past experiences of picking up a cup, being thirsty, drinking from a cup, feeling the rim of a cup against your lips, having breakfast and so on? 
³Are not your aesthetic reäctions to the cup, too, based on past experiences? 
⁴How else would you know whether or not this kind of cup will break if you drop it? 
⁵What do you know about this cup except what you learned in the past? 
⁶You would have no idea what this cup is, except for your past learning. 
⁷Do you, then, really see it?

4. Look about you. 
²This is equally true of whatever you look at. 
³Acknowledge this by applying the idea for today indiscriminately to whatever catches your eye. 
⁴For example:

>⁵I see only the past in this pencil.  
⁶I see only the past in this shoe.  
⁷I see only the past in this hand.  
⁸I see only the past in that body.  
⁹I see only the past in that face.

5. Do not linger over any one thing in particular, but remember to omit nothing specifically. 
²Glance briefly at each subject, and then move on to the next. 
³Three or four practice periods, each to last a minute or so, will be enough.
