1. The exercises with this idea are the same as those for the first one. 
²Begin with the things that are near you, and apply the idea to whatever your glance rests on. 
³Then increase the range outward. 
⁴Turn your head so that you include whatever is on either side. 
⁵If possible, turn around and apply the idea to what was behind you. 
⁶Remain as indiscriminate as possible in selecting subjects for its application, do not concentrate on anything in particular, and do not attempt to include everything you see in a given area, or you will introduce strain.

2. Merely glance easily and fairly quickly around you, trying to avoid selection by size, brightness, colour, material or relative importance to you. 
²Take the subjects simply as you see them. 
³Try to apply the exercise with equal ease to a body or a button, a fly or a floor, an arm or an apple. 
⁴The sole criterion for applying the idea to anything is merely that your eyes have lighted on it. 
⁵Make no attempt to include anything particular, but be sure that nothing is specifically excluded.
