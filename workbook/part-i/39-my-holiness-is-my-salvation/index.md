5. A full five minutes are urged for the four longer practice periods for today, and longer and more frequent practice sessions are encouraged. 
²If you want to exceed the minimum requirements, more rather than longer sessions are recommended, although both are suggested.

6. Begin the practice periods as usual, by repeating today’s idea to yourself. 
²Then, with closed eyes, search out your unloving thoughts in whatever form they appear; uneasiness, depression, anger, fear, worry, attack, insecurity and so on. 
³Whatever form they take, they are unloving and therefore fearful. 
⁴And so it is from them that you need to be saved.

7. Specific situations, events or personalities you associate with unloving thoughts of any kind are suitable subjects for today’s exercises. 
²It is imperative for your salvation that you see them differently. 
³And it is your blessing on them that will save you and give you vision.

8. Slowly, without conscious selection and without undue emphasis on any one in particular, search your mind for every thought that stands between you and your salvation. 
²Apply the idea for today to each of them in this way:

>³My unloving thoughts about _____ are keeping me in hell.  
⁴My holiness is my salvation.

9. You may find these practice periods easier if you intersperse them with several short periods during which you merely repeat today’s idea to yourself slowly a few times. 
²You may also find it helpful to include a few short intervals in which you just relax and do not seem to be thinking of anything. 
³Sustained concentration is very difficult at first. 
⁴It will become much easier as your mind becomes more disciplined and less distractible.

10. Meanwhile, you should feel free to introduce variety into the exercise periods in whatever form appeals to you. 
²Do not, however, change the idea itself as you vary the method of applying it. 
³However you elect to use it, the idea should be stated so that its meaning is the fact that your holiness is your salvation. 
⁴End each practice period by repeating the idea in its original form once more, and adding:

>⁵If guilt is hell, what is its opposite?

11. In the shorter applications, which should be made some three or four times an hour and more if possible, you may ask yourself this question, repeat today’s idea, and preferably both. 
²If temptations arise, a particularly helpful form of the idea is:

>³My holiness is my salvation from this.
