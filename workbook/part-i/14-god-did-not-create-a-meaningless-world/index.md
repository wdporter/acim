1. The idea for today is, of course, the reason why a meaningless world is impossible. 
²What God did not create does not exist. 
³And everything that does exist exists as He created it. 
⁴The world you see has nothing to do with reality. 
⁵It is of your own making, and it does not exist.

2. The exercises for today are to be practiced with eyes closed throughout. 
²The mind-searching period should be short, a minute at most. 
³Do not have more than three practice periods with today's idea unless you find them comfortable. 
⁴If you do, it will be because you really understand what they are for.


3. The idea for today is another step in learning to let go the thoughts that you have written on the world, and see the Word of God in their place. 
²The early steps in this exchange, which can truly be called salvation, can be quite difficult and even quite painful. 
³Some of them will lead you directly into fear. 
⁴You will not be left there. 
⁵You will go far beyond it. 
⁶Our direction is toward perfect safety and perfect peace.

4. With eyes closed, think of all the horrors in the world that cross your mind. 
²Name each one as it occurs to you, and then deny its reality. 
³God did not create it, and so it is not real. 
⁴Say, for example:

>⁵God did not create that war, and so it is not real.  
⁶God did not create that airplane crash, and so it is not real.  
⁷God did not create that disaster [specify], and so it is not real.

5. Suitable subjects for the application of today's idea also include anything you are afraid might happen to you, or to anyone about whom you are concerned. 
²In each case, name the ‘disaster’ quite specifically. 
³Do not use general terms. 
⁴For example, do not say, “God did not create illness”, but, “God did not create cancer”, or heart attacks, or whatever may arouse fear in you.

6. This is your personal repertory of horrors at which you are looking. 
²These things are part of the world you see. 
³Some of them are shared illusions, and others are part of your personal hell. 
⁴It does not matter. 
⁵What God did not create can only be in your own mind apart from His. 
⁶Therefore, it has no meaning. 
⁷In recognition of this fact, conclude the practice periods by repeating today's idea:

>8 God did not create a meaningless world.

7. The idea for today can, of course, be applied to anything that disturbs you during the day, aside from the practice periods. 
²Be very specific in applying it. 
³Say:

>⁴God did not create a meaningless world. 
⁵He did not create [specify the situation which is disturbing you], and so it is not real.
