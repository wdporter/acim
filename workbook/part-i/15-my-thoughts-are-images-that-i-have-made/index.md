4. In practicing the idea for today, repeat it first to yourself, and then apply it to whatever you see around you, using its name and letting your eyes rest on it as you say:

>²This _____ is an image that I have made.  
³That _____ is an image that I have made.

⁴It is not necessary to include a large number of specific subjects for the application of today’s idea. 
⁵It is necessary, however, to continue to look at each subject while you repeat the idea to yourself. 
⁶The idea should be repeated quite slowly each time.

5. Although you will obviously not be able to apply the idea to very many things during the minute or so of practice that is recommended, try to make the selection as random as possible. 
²Less than a minute will do for the practice periods, if you begin to feel uneasy. 
³Do not have more than three application periods for today's idea unless you feel completely comfortable with it, and do not exceed four. 
⁴However, the idea can be applied as needed throughout the day.
