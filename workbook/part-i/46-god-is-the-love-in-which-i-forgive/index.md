1. God does not forgive because He has never condemned. 
²And there must be condemnation before forgiveness is necessary. 
³Forgiveness is the great need of this world, but that is because it is a world of illusions. 
⁴Those who forgive are thus releasing themselves from illusions, while those who withhold forgiveness are binding themselves to them. 
⁵As you condemn only yourself, so do you forgive only yourself.

2. Yet although God does not forgive, His Love is nevertheless the basis of forgiveness. 
²Fear condemns and love forgives. 
³Forgiveness thus undoes what fear has produced, returning the mind to the awareness of God. 
⁴For this reason, forgiveness can truly be called salvation. 
⁵It is the means by which illusions disappear.

3. Today’s exercises require at least three full five-minute practice periods, and as many shorter ones as possible. 
²Begin the longer practice periods by repeating today’s idea to yourself, as usual. 
³Close your eyes as you do so, and spend a minute or two in searching your mind for those whom you have not forgiven. 
⁴It does not matter ‘how much’ you have not forgiven them. 
⁵You have forgiven them entirely or not at all.


4. If you are doing the exercises well you should have no difficulty in finding a number of people you have not forgiven. 
²It is a safe rule that anyone you do not like is a suitable subject. 
³Mention each one by name, and say:

>⁴God is the Love in which I forgive you, [name].


5. The purpose of the first phase of today’s practice periods is to put you in a position to forgive yourself. 
²After you have applied the idea to all those who have come to mind, tell yourself:

>³God is the Love in which I forgive myself.

⁴Then devote the remainder of the practice period to adding related ideas such as:

>⁵God is the Love with which I love myself.  
⁶God is the Love in which I am blessed.

6. The form of the application may vary considerably, but the central idea should not be lost sight of. 
²You might say, for example:

>³I cannot be guilty because I am a Son of God.  
⁴I have already been forgiven.  
⁵No fear is possible in a mind beloved of God.  
⁶There is no need to attack because love has forgiven me.

⁷The practice period should end, however, with a repetition of today’s idea as originally stated.


7. The shorter practice periods may consist either of a repetition of the idea for today in the original or in a related form, as you prefer. 
²Be sure, however, to make more specific applications if they are needed. 
³They will be needed at any time during the day when you become aware of any kind of negative reäction to anyone, present or not. 
⁴In that event, tell him silently:

>⁵God is the Love in which I forgive you.
