1. Today’s idea holds the key to what your real thoughts are. 
²They are nothing that you think you think, just as nothing that you think you see is related to vision in any way. 
³There is no relationship between what is real and what you think is real. 
⁴Nothing that you think are your real thoughts resemble your real thoughts in any respect. 
⁵Nothing that you think you see bears any resemblance to what vision will show you.

2. You think with the Mind of God. 
²Therefore you share your thoughts with Him, as He shares His with you. 
³They are the same thoughts, because they are thought by the same Mind. 
⁴To share is to make alike, or to make one. 
⁵Nor do the thoughts you think with the Mind of God leave your mind, because thoughts do not leave their source. 
⁶Therefore, your thoughts are in the Mind of God, as you are. 
⁷They are in your mind as well, where He is. 
⁸As you are part of His Mind, so are your thoughts part of His Mind.

3. Where, then, are your real thoughts? 
²Today we will attempt to reach them. 
³We will have to look for them in your mind, because that is where they are. 
⁴They must still be there, because they cannot have left their source. 
⁵What is thought by the Mind of God is eternal, being part of creation.

4. Our three five-minute practice periods for today will take the same general form that we used in applying yesterday’s idea. 
²We will attempt to leave the unreal and seek for the real. 
³We will deny the world in favour of truth. 
⁴We will not let the thoughts of the world hold us back. 
⁵We will not let the beliefs of the world tell us that what God would have us do is impossible. 
⁶Instead, we will try to recognise that only what God would have us do is possible.


5. We will also try to understand that only what God would have us do is what we want to do. 
²And we will also try to remember that we cannot fail in doing what He would have us do. 
³There is every reason to feel confident that we will succeed today. 
⁴It is the Will of God.


6. Begin the exercises for today by repeating the idea to yourself, closing your eyes as you do so. 
²Then spend a fairly short period in thinking a few relevant thoughts of your own, keeping the idea in mind. 
³After you have added some four or five thoughts of your own to the idea, repeat it again and tell yourself gently:

>⁴My real thoughts are in my mind. 
⁵I would like to find them.

⁶Then try to go past all the unreal thoughts that cover the truth in your mind, and reach to the eternal.

7. Under all the senseless thoughts and mad ideas with which you have cluttered up your mind are the thoughts that you thought with God in the beginning. 
²They are there in your mind now, completely unchanged. 
³They will always be in your mind, exactly as they always were. 
⁴Everything you have thought since then will change, but the Foundation on which it rests is wholly changeless.


8. It is this Foundation toward which the exercises for today are directed. 
²Here is your mind joined with the Mind of God. 
³Here are your thoughts one with His. 
⁴For this kind of practice only one thing is necessary; approach it as you would an altar dedicated in Heaven to God the Father and to God the Son. 
⁵For such is the place you are trying to reach. 
⁶You will probably be unable as yet to realise how high you are trying to go. 
⁷Yet even with the little understanding you have already gained, you should be able to remind yourself that this is no idle game, but an exercise in holiness and an attempt to reach the Kingdom of Heaven.


9. In the shorter exercise periods for today, try to remember how important it is to you to understand the holiness of the mind that thinks with God. 
²Take a minute or two, as you repeat the idea throughout the day, to appreciate your mind’s holiness. 
³Stand aside, however briefly, from all thoughts that are unworthy of Him Whose host you are. 
⁴And thank Him for the Thoughts He is thinking with you.
