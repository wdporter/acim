3. If you are holy, so is everything God created. 
²You are holy because all things He created are holy. 
³And all things He created are holy because you are. 
⁴In today's exercises, we will apply the power of your holiness to all problems, difficulties or suffering in any form that you happen to think of, in yourself or in someone else. 
⁵We will make no distinctions because there are no distinctions.

4. In the four longer practice periods, each preferably to last a full five minutes, repeat the idea for today, close your eyes, and then search your mind for any sense of loss or unhappiness of any kind as you see it. 
²Try to make as little distinction as possible between a situation that is difficult for you, and one that is difficult for someone else. 
³Identify the situation specifically, and also the name of the person concerned. 
⁴Use this form in applying the idea for today:

>⁵In the situation involving _____ in which I see myself, there is nothing that my holiness cannot do.  
⁶In the situation involving _____ in which _____ sees himself, there is nothing my holiness cannot do.

5. From time to time you may want to vary this procedure, and add some relevant thoughts of your own. 
²You might like, for example, to include thoughts such as:

>³There is nothing my holiness cannot do because the power of God lies in it.

⁴Introduce whatever variations appeal to you, but keep the exercises focused on the theme, “There is nothing my holiness cannot do”. 
⁵The purpose of today’s exercises is to begin to instill in you a sense that you have dominion over all things because of what you are.

6. In the frequent shorter applications, apply the idea in its original form unless a specific problem concerning you or someone else arises, or comes to mind. 
²In that event, use the more specific form in applying the idea to it.
