1. We have been quite casual about our practice periods thus far. 
²There has been virtually no attempt to direct the time for undertaking them, minimal effort has been required, and not even active coöperation and interest have been asked. 
³This approach has been intentional, and very carefully planned. 
⁴We have not lost sight of the crucial importance of the reversal of your thinking. 
⁵The salvation of the world depends on it. 
⁶Yet you will not see if you regard yourself as being coërced, and if you give in to resentment and opposition.

2. This is our first attempt to introduce structure. 
²Do not misconstrue it as an effort to exert force or pressure. 
³You want salvation. 
⁴You want to be happy. 
⁵You want peace. 
⁶You do not have them now, because your mind is totally undisciplined, and you cannot distinguish between joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain, love and fear. 
⁷You are now learning how to tell them apart. 
⁸And great indeed will be your reward.

3. Your decision to see is all that vision requires. 
²What you want is yours. 
³Do not mistake the little effort that is asked of you for an indication that our goal is of little worth. 
⁴Can the salvation of the world be a trivial purpose? 
⁵And can the world be saved if you are not? 
⁶God has one Son, and he is the resurrection and the life. 
⁷His will is done because all power is given him in Heaven and on earth. 
⁸In your determination to see is vision given you.

4. The exercises for today consist in reminding yourself throughout the day that you want to see. 
²Today’s idea also tacitly implies the recognition that you do not see now. 
³Therefore, as you repeat the idea, you are stating that you are determined to change your present state for a better one, and one you really want.

5. Repeat today’s idea slowly and positively at least twice an hour today, attempting to do so every half hour. 
²Do not be distressed if you forget to do so, but make a real effort to remember. 
³The extra repetitions should be applied to any situation, person or event that upsets you. 
⁴You can see them differently, and you will. 
⁵What you desire you will see. 
⁶Such is the real law of cause and effect as it operates in the world.
