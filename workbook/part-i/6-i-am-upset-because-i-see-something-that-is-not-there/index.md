# LESSON 6

# I am upset because I see something that is not there.

<a name=w-pi-6-1></a>1.&emsp;The exercises with this idea are very similar to the preceding ones. ²Again, it is necessary to name both the form of upset (anger, fear, worry, depression and so on) and the perceived source very specifically for any application of the idea. ³For example:

<div class="indent italic">

⁴I am angry at _____ because I see something that is not there.  
⁵I am worried about _____ because I see something that is not there.

</div>

<a name=w-pi-6.2></a>2.&emsp;Today’s idea is useful for application to anything that seems to upset you, and can profitably be used throughout the day for that purpose. ²However, the three or four practice periods which are required should be preceded by a minute or so of mind searching, as before, and the application of the idea to each upsetting thought uncovered in the search.

<a name=w-pi-6-3></a>3.&emsp;Again, if you resist applying the idea to some upsetting thoughts more than to others, remind yourself of the two cautions stated in the previous lesson:

<div class="indented italic">

²There are no small upsets. ³They are all equally disturbing to my peace of mind.

</div>

<div class=centred>

⁴And:

<div class="indented italic">

⁵I cannot keep this form of upset and let the others go. ⁶For the purposes of these exercises, then, I will regard them all as the same.
