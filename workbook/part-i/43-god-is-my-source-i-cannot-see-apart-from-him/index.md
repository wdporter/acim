1. Perception is not an attribute of God. 
²His is the realm of knowledge. 
³Yet He has created the Holy Spirit as the Mediator between perception and knowledge. 
⁴Without this link with God, perception would have replaced knowledge forever in your mind. 
⁵With this link with God, perception will become so changed and purified that it will lead to knowledge. 
⁶That is its function as the Holy Spirit sees it. 
⁷Therefore, that is its function in truth.

2. In God you cannot see. 
²Perception has no function in God, and does not exist. 
³Yet in salvation, which is the undoing of what never was, perception has a mighty purpose. 
⁴Made by the Son of God for an unholy purpose, it must become the means for the restoration of his holiness to his awareness. 
⁵Perception has no meaning. 
⁶Yet does the Holy Spirit give it a meaning very close to God’s. 
⁷Healed perception becomes the means by which the Son of God forgives his brother, and thus forgives himself.

In God you cannot see. 
²Perception has no function in God, and perception does not exist. 
³Yet in salvation — salvation is the undoing of what never was — perception has a mighty purpose. 
⁴Perception is made by the Son of God for an unholy purpose; perception must become the means for the restoration of the-Son-of-God’s holiness to the-Son-of-God’s awareness. 
⁵Perception has no meaning. 
⁶Yet does the Holy Spirit give perception a meaning very close to God’s meaning. 
⁷Healed perception becomes the means; by healed perception the Son of God forgives the-Son-of-God’s brother, and thus forgives the-Son-of-God’s-self.

##### Simplified

Your perception can be healed. 
Healed perception lets you forgive your brother and yourself.

3. You cannot see apart from God because you cannot be apart from God. 
²Whatever you do you do in Him, because whatever you think, you think with His Mind. 
³If vision is real, and it is real to the extent to which it shares the Holy Spirit’s purpose, then you cannot see apart from God.

4. Three five-minute practice periods are required today, one as early and one as late as possible in the day. 
²The third may be undertaken at the most convenient and suitable time that circumstances and readiness permit.
³At the beginning of these practice periods, repeat the idea for today to yourself with eyes open. 
⁴Then glance around you for a short time, applying the idea specifically to what you see. 
⁵Four or five subjects for this phase of the practice period are sufficient. 
⁶You might say, for example:

>⁷God is my Source. 
⁸I cannot see this desk apart from Him.  
⁹God is my Source. 
¹⁰I cannot see that picture apart from Him.


5. Although this part of the exercise period should be relatively short, be sure that you select the subjects for this phase of practice indiscriminately, without self-directed inclusion or exclusion. 
²For the second and longer phase, close your eyes, repeat today’s idea again, and then let whatever relevant thoughts occur to you add to the idea in your own personal way. 
³Thoughts such as:

>⁴I see through the eyes of forgiveness.  
⁵I see the world as blessed.  
⁶The world can show me myself.  
⁷I see my own thoughts, which are like God’s.

⁸Any thought related more or less directly to today’s idea is suitable. 
⁹The thoughts need not bear any obvious relationship to the idea, but they should not be in opposition to it.

6. If you find your mind wandering; if you begin to be aware of thoughts which are clearly out of accord with today’s idea, or if you seem to be unable to think of anything, open your eyes, repeat the first phase of the exercise period, and then attempt the second phase again. 
²Do not allow any protracted period to occur in which you become preöccupied with irrelevant thoughts. 
³Return to the first phase of the exercises as often as necessary to prevent this.

7. In applying today’s idea in the shorter practice periods, the form may vary according to the circumstances and situations in which you find yourself during the day. 
²When you are with someone else, for example, try to remember to tell him silently:

>³God is my Source. 
⁴I cannot see you apart from Him.

⁵This form is equally applicable to strangers as it is to those you think are closer to you. 
⁶In fact, try not to make distinctions of this kind at all.


8. Today’s idea should also be applied throughout the day to various situations and events that may occur, particularly to those which seem to distress you in any way. 
²For this purpose, apply the idea in this form:

>³God is my Source. 
⁴I cannot see this apart from Him.

9. If no particular subject presents itself to your awareness at the time, merely repeat the idea in its original form. 
²Try today not to allow any long periods of time to slip by without remembering today’s idea, and thus remembering your function.
