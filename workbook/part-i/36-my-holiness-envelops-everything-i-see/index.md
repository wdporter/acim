2. Four three-to-five-minute practice periods are required for today. 
²Try to distribute them fairly evenly, and make the shorter applications frequently, to protect your protection throughout the day. 
³The longer practice periods should take this form:

3. First, close your eyes and repeat the idea for today several times, slowly. 
²Then open your eyes and look quite slowly about you, applying the idea specifically to whatever you note in your casual survey. 
³Say, for example:

>⁴My holiness envelops that rug.  
⁵My holiness envelops that wall.  
⁶My holiness envelops these fingers.  
⁷My holiness envelops that chair.  
⁸My holiness envelops that body.  
⁹My holiness envelops this pen.

¹⁰Several times during these practice periods, close your eyes and repeat the idea to yourself. 
¹¹Then open your eyes, and continue as before.

4. For the shorter exercise periods, close your eyes and repeat the idea; look about you as you repeat it again; and conclude with one more repetition with your eyes closed. 
²All applications should, of course, be made quite slowly, as effortlessly and unhurriedly as possible.
