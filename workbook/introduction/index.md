1.&emsp;A theoretical foundation such as the text provides is necessary as a framework to make the exercises in this workbook meaningful. 
²Yet it is doing the exercises that will make the goal of the course possible. 
³An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. 
⁴It is the purpose of this workbook to train your mind to think along the lines the text sets forth.

::: details Simplified

The text is the theory. 
Theory is necessary. 
You also need training. 
This workbook trains your mind to think according to the theory.

<!--::: details Commentary

Jesus conceived of his Course as an integrated work in which each book had its own particular place, making a unique contrbution to the student’s learning and growth, as well as being integrated with the other two books. (Wapnick F.C.T.L, p.11)

(1) *A Course in Miracles* is a unified curriculum, and the three books need to be studied and used as a set, even though the actual sequence of study is left to the individual student and the Holy Spirit — “The curriculumn is highly individualised, and all aspects are under the Holy Spirit’s particuralr care and guidance” ([M-29.2:6](/manual/29-as-for-the-rest#m-29-2)). The workbook, therefore, is not meaningful without the text. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.603)

(1) At the very beginning of the workbook, Jesus underscores this relationship between theory and application, both of which are essential fo rthe completion of *A Course in Miracles*’ curriculumn (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.227)

(2–3) …the workbook provides the practical application of the principles of the text (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.603)

(3–4) …in order to accomplish the Course’s purpose of retraining our minds, some structure is obviously necessary (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.550, 

(3–4) Such structure is particularly important in the early stages of one’s growth, and it is obviously between the individual and the Holy Spirit to determine the parameters of “early”. (A.A.C.,p.274)

(4) …the workbook clarifies its purpose (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.603)

(4) Once we are able to dislodge our thinking from the ego — the puprpose of this training — we must spend the rest of our lives reïnforcing what we have learned, attempting to remember to apply its principles to *all* situations and relationships. It is this generalisation of forgiveness, without exception, that constitutes the difficulty in hearing the Holy Spirit clearly and consistently. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.269)

(4) Although certainly [the workbook] does contain some important passages bearing on an a number of themes in the text, it does not aim at presenting or explaining the thought system of *A Course in Miracles*. (Wapnick, F.C.T.L., p.17)

The workbook is divided into two main sections, the first dealing with the undoing of the way you see now, and the second with the acquisition of true perception. 
²With the exception of the review periods, each day’s exercises are planned around one central idea, which is stated first. 
³This is followed by a description of the specific procedures by which the idea for the day is to be applied.

<!--::: details Commentary
(1–2 and 5:1–2) …it is the Course’s uncompromising metaphysical absoluteness that is deeply problematic for many people. One of its stated goals, therefore, is to effect a total transfer of learning, for “the impariment of the ability to generalise is a crucial learning failure” ([T-12.V.6:4](/text/12-the-holy-spirits-curriculum#t-12-v-6)). (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.595; F.C.T.L, p.154)

5.&emsp;Transfer of training in true perception does not proceed as does transfer of the training of the world. 
²If true perception has been achieved in connection with any person, situation or event, total transfer to everyone and everything is certain. 
³On the other hand, one exception held apart from true perception makes its accomplishments anywhere impossible.

6.&emsp;The only general rules to be observed throughout, then, are: First, that the exercises be practiced with great specificity, as will be indicated. 
²This will help you to generalise the ideas involved to every situation in which you find yourself, and to everyone and everything in it. 
³Second, be sure that you do not decide for yourself that there are some people, situations or things to which the ideas are inapplicable. 
⁴This will interfere with transfer of training. 
⁵The very nature of true perception is that it has no limits. 
⁶It is the opposite of the way you see now.

<!--::: details Commentary
(3–6) The course’s focus is always practical, dealing with specific ways in which to undo the interferences in our spiritual growth. Emphasis on doctrinal issues, in the context of the Course, would tend to impede one’s learning and practice of its principles. (Wapnick, C.P., p.1)

(3, 5, 9:4) The introduction to the workbook highlights the important place that *using* the Course’s ideas has in the curriculum (Wapnick, F.C.T.L., p.25)

²Some of them you may actively resist. 
³None of this will matter, or decrease their efficacy. 
⁴But do not allow yourself to make exceptions in applying the ideas the workbook contains, and whatever your reäctions to the ideas may be, use them. 
⁵Nothing more than that is required.
