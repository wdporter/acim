    <p>This is a <em>catena aurea</em> (golden chain) for <em>A Course in Miracles</em>.
    <p>The course text is supplied in alternative renderings which substitute pronouns.
		<p>This is done to help clarify some confusing paragraphs. It is not an attempt to render it easier to read, but rather to provide an aid to study.
		<p>Substituting pronouns replaces Him and He, thus de-gendering God, but this was NOT the point of the exercise.
		<p>I also try to clarify the adverbial ‘but’. I find this annoying and confusing.
    <p>I have provided a summary for each paragraph. The summary is my own. I do not claim these summaries are in any way ‘scribed’ or ‘channelled’ or even ‘inspired’, but I did at times need to ask for guidance.
    <p>I have also provided excerpts from well known course commentators. This is the Golden Chain.
		<p>Yes, I changed some of the spelling and punctuation to reflect a more ‘British’ orientation. Some personal prejudices are also reflected thereby. If you believe this is wrong, you can let me know why. Maybe I’ll change my mind.
    <p>I very much welcome correspondence with suggestions for improvements or additions.
    <p>The site is built with static site generator Jekyll and the <a href=https://github.com/W-David-Porter/acim>sources are in github https://github.com/W-David-Porter/acim</a>. 
    <p>If you don't know what github is, you can <a href=mailto:acim@fea.st>email me</a> instead. 
    <p>Help with CSS and site design would be appreciated also.
