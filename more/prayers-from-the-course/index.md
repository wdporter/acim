## From the Ur-Text

I would like to pray that my will be united with yours, recognising that your perfect love will suffice (or correct) for my imperfect love. 

I pray that I may accept the Atonement with conviction, recognising its inevitable worth, and my own divine worth as part of this identification with you. 

I pray that my fear be replaced by an active sense of your love, and your continual willingness to help me overcome the split, or divided will, which is responsible for my difficulty with this. 

I accept the divinity of the messages we have received, and affirm my will in both accepting and acting upon the Atonement principle.

Here I am.


## Spirit is in a State of Grace Forever
Spirit is in a state of grace forever.  
Your reality is only spirit.

## Perfect Love Casts out Fear
Perfect love casts out fear.  
If fear exists,  
Then there is not perfect love.  

  But:  

Only perfect love exists.  
If there is fear,  
It produces a state that does not exist.

## I am Here Only to be Truly Helpful 
I am here only to be truly helpful.  
I am here to represent Him Who sent me.

I am content to be wherever He wishes, knowing He goes there with me.  
I will be healed as I let Him teach me to heal.

## You Need Not Have Tribulation
In this world you need not have tribulation because I have overcome the world.

## I Must Have Decided Wrongly
I must have decided wrongly, because I am not at peace.  
I made wrong decision myself, but I can also decide otherwise.  
 want to decide otherwise, because I want to be at peace.

I choose to let the Holy Spirit, by allowing the Holy Spirit to decide for God for me.
