### Text

This is a course in miracles. 
It is a required course. 
Only the time you take it is voluntary. 
Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. 
It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. 
The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. 
It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of loveâ€™s presence, which is your natural inheritance. 
The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.

### Workbook for Students

A theoretical foundation, such as the text, is necessary as a background to make these exercises meaningful. 
Yet it is the exercises that will make the goal possible. 
An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. 
It is the purpose of these exercises to train the mind to think along the lines which the course sets forth.

### Manual for Teachers

The role of teaching and learning is actually reversed in the thinking of the world. 
The reversal is characteristic. 
It seems as if the teacher and the learner are separated, the teacher giving something to the learner rather than to himself. 
Further, the act of teaching is regarded as a special activity in which one engages only a relatively small proportion of oneâ€™s time. 
The course, on the other hand, emphasises that to teach is to learn, so that teacher and learner are the same. 
It also emphasises that teaching is a constant process; it goes on every moment of the day and continues into sleeping thoughts as well.
