1. The idea for today is a beginning step in dispelling the belief that your thoughts have no effect. 
Everything you see is the result of your thoughts. 
There is no exception to this fact. 
Thoughts are not big or little; powerful or weak. 
They are merely true or false. 
Those that are true create their own likeness. 
Those that are false make theirs.

2. There is no more self-contradictory concept than that of <q>idle thoughts</q>. 
What gives rise to the perception of a whole world can hardly be called idle. 
Every thought you have contributes to truth or to illusion; either it extends the truth or it multiplies illusions. 
You can indeed multiply nothing, but you will not extend it by doing so.

Every thought gives rise to a whole world. 
The world can be a world of truth or a world of illusions.

3. Besides your recognising that thoughts are never idle, salvation requires that you also recognise that every thought you have brings either peace or war; either love or fear. 
A neutral result is impossible because a neutral thought is impossible. 
There is such a temptation to dismiss fear thoughts as unimportant, trivial and not worth bothering about that it is essential you recognise them all as equally destructive, but equally unreal. 
We will practice this idea in many forms before you really understand it.

We will practice the idea, that all fear thoughts are equally destructive and equally unreal, in many forms before you really understand the idea that all fear thoughts are equally destructive and equally unreal.

Every thought you have brings either positive or negative. 
Thoughts cannot be neutral. 
All fear thoughts are destructive and unreal.

4. In applying the idea for today, search your mind for a minute or so with eyes closed, and actively seek not to overlook any <q>little</q> thought that may tend to elude the search. 
This is quite difficult until you get used to it. 
You will find that it is still hard for you not to make artificial distinctions. 
Every thought that occurs to you, regardless of the qualities that you assign to it, is a suitable subject for applying today’s idea.

5. In the practice periods, first repeat the idea to yourself, and then as each one crosses your mind hold it in awareness while you tell yourself:

>This thought about _____ is not a neutral thought.  
That thought about _____ is not a neutral thought.

As usual, use today’s idea whenever you are aware of a particular thought that arouses uneasiness. 
The following form is suggested for this purpose:

>This thought about _____ is not a neutral thought, because I have no neutral thoughts.

6. Four or five practice periods are recommended, if you find them relatively effortless. 
If strain is experienced, three will be enough. 
The length of the exercise period should also be reduced if there is discomfort.
