1. Apply this idea in the same way as the previous ones, without making distinctions of any kind. 
Whatever you see becomes a proper subject for applying the idea. 
Be sure that you do not question the suitability of anything for application of the idea. 
These are not exercises in judgment. 
Anything is suitable if you see it. 
Some of the things you see may have emotionally-charged meaning for you. 
Try to lay such feelings aside, and merely use these things exactly as you would anything else.

2. The point of the exercises is to help you clear your mind of all past associations, to see things exactly as they appear to you now, and to realize how little you really understand about them. 
It is therefore essential that you keep a perfectly open mind, unhampered by judgment, in selecting the things to which the idea for the day is to be applied. 
For this purpose one thing is like another: equally suitable and therefore equally useful.
