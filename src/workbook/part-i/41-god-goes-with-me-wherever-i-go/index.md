2. The separated ones have invented many <q>cures</q> for what they believe to be <q>the ills of the world</q>. 
But the one thing they do not do is to question the reality of the problem. 
Yet its effects cannot be cured because the problem is not real. 
The idea for today has the power to end all this foolishness forever. 
 And foolishness it is, despite the serious and tragic forms it may take.

5. We understand that you do not believe all this. 
How could you, when the truth is hidden deep within, under a heavy cloud of insane thoughts, dense and obscuring, yet representing all you see? 
Today we will make our first real attempt to get past this dark and heavy cloud, and to go through it to the light beyond.


6. There will be only one long practice period today. 
In the morning, as soon as you get up if possible, sit quietly for some three to five minutes, with your eyes closed. 
At the beginning of the practice period, repeat today’s idea very slowly. 
Then make no effort to think of anything. 
Try, instead, to get a sense of turning inward, past all the idle thoughts of the world. 
Try to enter very deeply into your own mind, keeping it clear of any thoughts that might divert your attention.


7. From time to time, you may repeat the idea if you find it helpful. 
But most of all, try to sink down and inward, away from the world and all the foolish thoughts of the world. 
You are trying to reach past all these things. 
You are trying to leave appearances and approach reality.


8. It is quite possible to reach God. 
In fact it is very easy, because it is the most natural thing in the world. 
You might even say it is the only natural thing in the world. 
The way will open, if you believe that it is possible. 
This exercise can bring very startling results even the first time it is attempted, and sooner or later it is always successful. 
We will go into more detail about this kind of practice as we go along. 
But it will never fail completely, and instant success is possible.


9. Throughout the day use today’s idea often, repeating it very slowly, preferably with eyes closed. 
Think of what you are saying; what the words mean. 
Concentrate on the holiness that they imply about you; on the unfailing companionship that is yours; on the complete protection that surrounds you.


10. You can indeed afford to laugh at fear thoughts, remembering that God goes with you wherever you go.
