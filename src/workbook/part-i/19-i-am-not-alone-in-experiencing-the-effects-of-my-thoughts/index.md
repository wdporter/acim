1. The idea for today is obviously the reason why your seeing does not affect you alone. 
²You will notice that at times the ideas related to thinking precede those related to perceiving, while at other times the order is reversed. 
³The reason is that the order does not matter. 
⁴Thinking and its results are really simultaneous, for cause and effect are never separate.

2. Today we are again emphasising the fact that minds are joined. 
²This is rarely a wholly welcome idea at first, since it seems to carry with it an enormous sense of responsibility, and may even be regarded as an ‘invasion of privacy’. 
³Yet it is a fact that there are no private thoughts. 
⁴Despite your initial resistance to this idea, you will yet understand that it must be true if salvation is possible at all. 
⁵And salvation must be possible because it is the Will of God.

3. The minute or so of mind searching which today’s exercises require is to be undertaken with eyes closed. 
²The idea for today is to be repeated first, and then the mind should be carefully searched for the thoughts it contains at that time. 
³As you consider each one, name it in terms of the central person or theme it contains, and holding it in your mind as you do so, say:

>⁴I am not alone in experiencing the effects of this thought about _____.

4. The requirement of as much indiscriminateness as possible in selecting subjects for the practice periods should be quite familiar to you by now, and will no longer be repeated each day, although it will occasionally be included as a reminder. 
²Do not forget, however, that random selection of subjects for all practice periods remains essential throughout. 
³Lack of order in this connection will ultimately make the recognition of lack of order in miracles meaningful to you.


5. Apart from the ‘as needed’ application of today’s idea, at least three practice periods are required, shortening the length of time involved, if necessary. 
²Do not attempt more than four.
