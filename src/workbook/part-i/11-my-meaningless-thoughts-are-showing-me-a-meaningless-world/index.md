2. The practice periods for today’s idea are to be undertaken somewhat differently from the previous ones. 
²Begin with your eyes closed, and repeat the idea slowly to yourself. 
³Then open your eyes and look about, near and far, up and down, — anywhere. 
⁴During the minute or so to be spent in using the idea merely repeat it to yourself, being sure to do so without haste, and with no sense of urgency or effort.

3. To do these exercises for maximum benefit, the eyes should move from one thing to another fairly rapidly, since they should not linger on anything in particular. 
²The words, however, should be used in an unhurried, even leisurely fashion. 
³The introduction to this idea, in particular, should be practiced as casually as possible. 
⁴It contains the foundation for the peace, relaxation and freedom from worry that we are trying to achieve. 
⁵On concluding the exercises, close your eyes and repeat the idea once more slowly to yourself.

4. Three practice periods today will probably be sufficient. 
²However, if there is little or no uneasiness and an inclination to do more, as many as five may be undertaken. 
³More than this is not recommended.
