<p>
1. Perhaps some of our concepts will become clearer and more personally meaningful if the ego’s use of guilt is clarified. 
²The ego has a purpose, just as the Holy Spirit has. 
³The ego’s purpose is fear, because only the fearful can be egotistic. 
⁴The ego’s logic is as impeccable as that of the Holy Spirit, because your mind has the means at its disposal to side with Heaven or earth, as it elects. 
⁵But again, remember that both are in you.

<p>
2. In Heaven there is no guilt, because the Kingdom is attained through the Atonement, which releases you to create. 
²The word <q>create</q> is appropriate here because, once what you have made is undone by the Holy Spirit, the blessed residue is restored and therefore continues in creation. 
³What is truly blessed is incapable of giving rise to guilt, and must give rise to joy. 
⁴This makes it invulnerable to the ego because its peace is unassailable. 
⁵It is invulnerable to disruption because it is whole. 
⁶Guilt is <em>always</em> disruptive. 
⁷Anything that engenders fear is divisive because it obeys the law of division. 
⁸If the ego is the symbol of the separation, it is also the symbol of guilt. 
⁹Guilt is more than merely not of God. 
¹⁰It is the symbol of attack on God. 
¹¹This is a totally meaningless concept except to the ego, but do not underestimate the power of the ego’s belief in it. 
¹²This is the belief from which all guilt really stems.

<p>
3. The ego is the part of the mind that believes in division. 
²How could part of God detach itself without believing it is attacking Him? 
³We spoke before of the authority problem as based on the concept of usurping God’s power. 
⁴The ego believes that this is what you did because it believes that it <em>is</em> you. 
⁵If you identify with the ego, you must perceive yourself as guilty. 
⁶Whenever you respond to your ego you will experience guilt, and you will fear punishment. 
⁷The ego is quite literally a fearful thought. 
⁸However ridiculous the idea of attacking God may be to the sane mind, never forget that the ego is not sane. 
⁹It represents a delusional system, and speaks for it. 
¹⁰Listening to the ego’s voice means that you believe it is possible to attack God, and that a part of Him has been torn away by you. 
¹¹Fear of retaliation from without follows, because the severity of the guilt is so acute that it must be projected.

<p>
4. Whatever you accept into your mind has reality for you. 
²It is your acceptance of it that makes it real. 
³If you enthrone the ego in your mind, your allowing it to enter makes it your reality. 
⁴This is because the mind is capable of creating reality or making illusions. 
⁵I said before that you must learn to think with God. 
⁶To think with Him is to think like Him. 
⁷This engenders joy, not guilt, because it is natural. 
⁸Guilt is a sure sign that your thinking is unnatural. 
⁹Unnatural thinking will always be attended with guilt, because it is the belief in sin. 
¹⁰The ego does not perceive sin as a lack of love, but as a positive act of assault. 
¹¹This is necessary to the ego’s survival because, as soon as you regard sin as a lack, you will automatically attempt to remedy the situation. 
¹²And you will succeed. 
¹³The ego regards this as doom, but you must learn to regard it as freedom.

<p>
5. The guiltless mind cannot suffer. 
²Being sane, the mind heals the body because <em>it</em> has been healed. 
³The sane mind cannot conceive of illness because it cannot conceive of attacking anyone or anything. 
⁴I said before that illness is a form of magic. 
⁵It might be better to say that it is a form of magical solution. 
⁶The ego believes that by punishing itself it will mitigate the punishment of God. 
⁷Yet even in this it is arrogant. 
⁸It attributes to God a punishing intent, and then takes this intent as its own prerogative. 
⁹It tries to usurp all the functions of God as it perceives them, because it recognises that only total allegiance can be trusted.

<p>
6. The ego cannot oppose the laws of God any more than you can, but it can interpret them according to what it wants, just as you can. 
²That is why the question, <q>What do you want?</q> must be answered. 
³You are answering it every minute and every second, and each moment of decision is a judgement that is anything but ineffectual. 
⁴Its effects will follow automatically until the decision is changed. 
⁵Remember, though, that the alternatives themselves are unalterable. 
⁶The Holy Spirit, like the ego, is a decision. 
⁷Together they constitute all the alternatives the mind can accept and obey. 
⁸The Holy Spirit and the ego are the only choices open to you. 
⁹God created one, and so you cannot eradicate it. 
¹⁰You made the other, and so you can. 
¹¹Only what God creates is irreversible and unchangeable. 
¹²What you made can always be changed because, when you do not think like God, you are not really thinking at all. 
¹³Delusional ideas are not real thoughts, although you can believe in them. 
¹⁴But you are wrong. 
¹⁵The function of thought comes from God and is in God. 
¹⁶As part of His Thought, you <em>cannot</em> think apart from Him.

<p>
7. Irrational thought is disordered thought. 
²God Himself orders your thought because your thought was created by Him. 
³Guilt feelings are always a sign that you do not know this. 
⁴They also show that you believe you can think apart from God, and want to. 
⁵Every disordered thought is attended by guilt at its inception, and maintained by guilt in its continuance. 
⁶Guilt is inescapable by those who believe they order their own thoughts, and must therefore obey their dictates. 
⁷This makes them feel responsible for their errors without recognising that, by accepting this responsibility, they are reäcting irresponsibly. 
⁸If the sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself, and I assure you that it is, then the responsibility for <em>what</em> is atoned for cannot be yours. 
⁹The dilemma cannot be resolved except by accepting the solution of undoing. 
¹⁰You <em>would</em> be responsible for the effects of all your wrong thinking if it could not be undone. 
¹¹The purpose of the Atonement is to save the past in purified form only. 
¹²If you accept the remedy for disordered thought, a remedy whose efficacy is beyond doubt, how can its symptoms remain?

<p>
8. The continuing decision to remain separated is the only possible reason for continuing guilt feelings. 
²We have said this before, but did not emphasise the destructive results of the decision. 
³Any decision of the mind will affect both behaviour and experience. 
⁴What you want you expect. 
⁵This is not delusional. 
⁶Your mind <em>does</em> make your future, and it will turn it back to full creation at any minute if it accepts the Atonement first. 
⁷It will also return to full creation the instant it has done so. 
⁸Having given up its disordered thought, the proper ordering of thought becomes quite apparent.
