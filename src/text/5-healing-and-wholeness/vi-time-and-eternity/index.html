<p>
1. God in His knowledge is not waiting, but His Kingdom is bereft while <em>you</em> wait. 
²All the Sons of God are waiting for your return, just as you are waiting for theirs. 
³Delay does not matter in eternity, but it is tragic in time. 
⁴You have elected to be in time rather than eternity, and therefore believe you <em>are</em> in time. 
⁵Yet your election is both free and alterable. 
⁶You do not belong in time. 
⁷Your place is only in eternity, where God Himself placed you forever.

<p>
2. Guilt feelings are the preservers of time. 
²They induce fears of retaliation or abandonment, and thus ensure that the future will be like the past. 
³This is the ego’s continuity. 
⁴It gives the ego a false sense of security by believing that you cannot escape from it. 
⁵But you can and must. 
⁶God offers you the continuity of eternity in exchange. 
⁷When you choose to make this exchange, you will simultaneously exchange guilt for joy, viciousness for love, and pain for peace. 
⁸My role is only to unchain your will and set it free. 
⁹Your ego cannot accept this freedom, and will oppose it at every possible moment and in every possible way. 
¹⁰And as its maker, you recognize what it can do because you gave it the power to do it.

<p>
3. Remember the Kingdom always, and remember that you who are part of the Kingdom cannot be lost. 
²The Mind that was in me <em>is</em> in you, for God creates with perfect fairness. 
³Let the Holy Spirit remind you always of His fairness, and let me teach you how to share it with your brothers. 
⁴How else can the chance to claim it for yourself be given you? 
⁵The two voices speak for different interpretations of the same thing simultaneously; or almost simultaneously, for the ego always speaks first. 
⁶Alternate interpretations were unnecessary until the first one was made.

<p>
4. The ego speaks in judgement, and the Holy Spirit reverses its decision, much as a higher court has the power to reverse a lower court’s decisions in this world. 
²The ego’s decisions are always wrong, because they are based on the error they were made to uphold. 
³Nothing the ego perceives is interpreted correctly. 
⁴Not only does the ego cite Scripture for its purpose, but it even interprets Scripture as a witness for itself. 
⁵The Bible is a fearful thing in the ego’s judgement. 
⁶Perceiving it as frightening, it interprets it fearfully. 
⁷Being afraid, you do not appeal to the Higher Court because you believe its judgement would also be against you.

<p>
5. There are many examples of how the ego’s interpretations are misleading, but a few will suffice to show how the Holy Spirit can reïnterpret them in His Own light.

<p>
6. <q>As ye sow, so shall ye reap</q> He interprets to mean what you consider worth cultivating you will cultivate in yourself. 
²Your judgement of what is worthy makes it worthy for you.

<p>
7. <q><q>Vengeance is mine</q>, says the Lord</q> is easily reïnterpreted if you remember that ideas increase only by being shared. 
²The statement emphasises that vengeance cannot be shared. 
³Give it therefore to the Holy Spirit, Who will undo it in you because it does not belong in your mind, which is part of God.

<p>
8. <q>I will visit the sins of the fathers unto the third and fourth generation</q>, as interpreted by the ego, is particularly vicious. 
²It becomes merely an attempt to guarantee the ego’s own survival. 
³To the Holy Spirit, the statement means that in later generations He can still reïnterpret what former generations had misunderstood, and thus release the thoughts from the ability to produce fear.

<p>
9. <q>The wicked shall perish</q> becomes a statement of Atonement, if the word <q>perish</q> is understood as <q>be undone</q>. 
²Every loveless thought must be undone, a word the ego cannot even understand. 
³To the ego, to be undone means to be destroyed. 
⁴The ego will not be destroyed because it is part of your thought, but because it is uncreative and therefore unsharing, it will be reïnterpreted to release you from fear. 
⁵The part of your mind that you have given to the ego will merely return to the Kingdom, where your whole mind belongs. 
⁶You can delay the completion of the Kingdom, but you cannot introduce the concept of fear into it.

<p>
10. You need not fear the Higher Court will condemn you. 
²It will merely dismiss the case against you. 
³There can be no case against a child of God, and every witness to guilt in God’s creations is bearing false witness to God Himself. 
⁴Appeal everything you believe gladly to God’s Own Higher Court, because it speaks for Him and therefore speaks truly. 
⁵It will dismiss the case against you, however carefully you have built it up. 
⁶The case may be fool-proof, but it is not God-proof. 
⁷The Holy Spirit will not hear it, because He can only witness truly. 
⁸His verdict will always be <q>yours is the Kingdom</q>, because He was given to you to remind you of what you are.

<p>
11. When I said <q>I am come as a light into the world</q>, I meant that I came to share the light with you. 
²Remember my reference to the ego’s dark glass, and remember also that I said, <q>Do not look there</q>.
³It is still true that where you look to find yourself is up to you. 
⁴Your patience with your brother is your patience with yourself. 
⁵Is not a child of God worth patience? 
⁶I have shown you infinite patience because my will is that of our Father, from Whom I learned of infinite patience. 
⁷His Voice was in me as It is in you, speaking for patience towards the Sonship in the Name of its Creator.


<p>
12. Now you must learn that only infinite patience produces immediate effects. 
²This is the way in which time is exchanged for eternity. 
³Infinite patience calls upon infinite love, and by producing results <em>now</em> it renders time unnecessary. 
⁴We have repeatedly said that time is a learning device to be abolished when it is no longer useful. 
⁵The Holy Spirit, Who speaks for God in time, also knows that time is meaningless. 
⁶He reminds you of this in every passing moment of time, because it is His special function to return you to eternity and remain to bless your creations there. 
⁷He is the only blessing you can truly give, because He is truly blessed. 
⁸Because He has been given you freely by God, you must give Him as you received Him.
