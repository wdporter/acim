<p>
1. What fear has hidden still is part of you. 
²Joining the Atonement is the way out of fear. 
³The Holy Spirit will help you reïnterpret everything that you perceive as fearful, and teach you that only what is loving is true. 
⁴Truth is beyond your ability to destroy, but entirely within your ability to accept. 
⁵It belongs to you because, as an extension of God, you created it with Him. 
⁶It is yours because it is part of you, just as you are part of God because He created you. 
⁷Nothing that is good can be lost because it comes from the Holy Spirit, the Voice for creation. 
⁸Nothing that is not good was ever created, and therefore cannot be protected. 
⁹The Atonement is the guarantee of the safety of the Kingdom, and the union of the Sonship is its protection. 
¹⁰The ego cannot prevail against the Kingdom because the Sonship is united.
¹¹In the presence of those who hear the Holy Spirit’s Call to be as one, the ego fades away and is undone.

<p>
2. What the ego makes it keeps to itself, and so it is without strength. 
²Its existence is unshared. 
³It does not die; it was merely never born. 
⁴Physical birth is not a beginning; it is a continuing. 
⁵Everything that continues has already been born. 
⁶It will increase as you are willing to return the unhealed part of your mind to the higher part, returning it undivided to creation. 
⁷I have come to give you the foundation, so your own thoughts can make you really free. 
⁸You have carried the burden of unshared ideas that are too weak to increase, but having made them you did not realise how to undo them. 
⁹You cannot cancel out your past errors alone. 
¹⁰They will not disappear from your mind without the Atonement, a remedy not of your making. 
¹¹The Atonement must be understood as a pure act of sharing. 
¹²That is what I meant when I said it is possible even in this world to listen to one Voice. 
¹³If you are part of God and the Sonship is One, you cannot be limited to the self the ego sees.

<p>
3. Every loving thought held in any part of the Sonship belongs to every part. 
²It is shared <em>because</em> it is loving. 
³Sharing is God’s way of creating, and also yours. 
⁴The ego can keep you in exile from the Kingdom, but in the Kingdom itself it has no power. 
⁵Ideas of the spirit do not leave the mind that thinks them, nor can they conflict with each other. 
⁶However, ideas of the ego can conflict because they occur at different levels and also include opposite thoughts at the same level. 
⁷<em>It is impossible to share opposing thoughts</em>. 
⁸You can share only the thoughts that are of God and that He keeps for you. 
⁹And of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. 
¹⁰The rest remains with you until the Holy Spirit has reïnterpreted them in the light of the Kingdom, making them, too, worthy of being shared. 
¹¹When they have been sufficiently purified He lets you give them away. 
¹²The decision to share them <em>is</em> their purification.

<p>
4. I heard one Voice because I understood that I could not atone for myself alone. 
²Listening to one Voice implies the decision to share It in order to hear It yourself. 
³The Mind that was in me is still irresistibly drawn to every mind created by God, because God’s Wholeness is the Wholeness of His Son. 
⁴You cannot be hurt, and do not want to show your brother anything except your wholeness. 
⁵Show him that he cannot hurt you and hold nothing against him, or you hold it against yourself. 
⁶This is the meaning of ‘turning the other cheek’.

<p>
5. Teaching is done in many ways, above all by example. 
²Teaching should be healing, because it is the sharing of ideas and the recognition that to share ideas is to strengthen them. 
³I cannot forget my need to teach what I have learned, which arose in me <em>because</em> I learned it. 
⁴I call upon you to teach what you have learned, because by so doing you can depend on it. 
⁵Make it dependable in my name because my name is the Name of God’s Son. 
⁶What I learned I give you freely, and the Mind that was in me rejoices as you choose to hear it.

<p>
6. The Holy Spirit atones in all of us by undoing, and thus lifts the burden you have placed in your mind. 
²By following Him you are led back to God where you belong, and how can you find the way except by taking your brother with you? 
³My part in the Atonement is not complete until you join it and give it away. 
⁴As you teach so shall you learn. 
⁵I will never leave you or forsake you, because to forsake you would be to forsake myself and God Who created me. 
⁶You forsake yourself and God if you forsake any of your brothers. 
⁷You must learn to see them as they are, and understand they belong to God as you do. 
⁸How could you treat your brother better than by rendering unto God the things that are God’s?

<p>
7. The Atonement gives you the power of a healed mind, but the power to create is of God. 
²Therefore, those who have been forgiven must devote themselves first to healing because, having received the idea of healing, they must give it to hold it. 
³The full power of creation cannot be expressed as long as any of God’s ideas is withheld from the Kingdom. 
⁴The joint will of the Sonship is the only creator that can create like the Father, because only the complete can think completely, and the thinking of God lacks nothing. 
⁵Everything you think that is not through the Holy Spirit <em>is</em> lacking.

<p>
8. How can you who are so holy suffer? 
²All your past except its beauty is gone, and nothing is left but a blessing. 
³I have saved all your kindnesses and every loving thought you ever had. 
⁴I have purified them of the errors that hid their light, and kept them for you in their own perfect radiance. 
⁵They are beyond destruction and beyond guilt. 
⁶They came from the Holy Spirit within you, and we know what God creates is eternal. 
⁷You can indeed depart in peace because I have loved you as I loved myself. 
⁸You go with my blessing and for my blessing. 
⁹Hold it and share it, that it may always be ours. 
¹⁰I place the peace of God in your heart and in your hands, to hold and share. 
¹¹The heart is pure to hold it, and the hands are strong to give it. 
¹²We cannot lose. 
¹³My judgement is as strong as the wisdom of God, in Whose Heart and Hands we have our being. 
¹⁴His quiet children are His blessed Sons. 
¹⁵The Thoughts of God are with you.
