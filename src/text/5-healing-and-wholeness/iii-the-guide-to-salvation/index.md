1. The way to recognise your brother is by recognising the Holy Spirit in him. 
²I have already said that the Holy Spirit is the Bridge for the transfer of perception to knowledge, so we can use the terms as if they were related, because in His Mind they are. 
³This relationship must be in His Mind because, unless it were, the separation between the two ways of thinking would not be open to healing. 
⁴He is part of the Holy Trinity, because His Mind is partly yours and also partly God’s. 
⁵This needs clarification, not in statement but in experience.

2. The Holy Spirit is the idea of healing. 
²Being thought, the idea gains as it is shared. 
³Being the Call *for* God, it is also the idea *of* God. 
⁴Since you are part of God it is also the idea of yourself, as well as of all His creations. 
⁵The idea of the Holy Spirit shares the property of other ideas because it follows the laws of the universe of which it is a part. 
⁶It is strengthened by being given away. 
⁷It increases in you as you give it to your brother. 
⁸Your brother does not have to be aware of the Holy Spirit in himself or in you for this miracle to occur. 
⁹He may have dissociated the Call for God, just as you have. 
¹⁰This dissociation is healed in both of you as you become aware of the Call for God in him, and thus acknowledge Its being.

3. There are two diametrically opposed ways of seeing your brother. 
²They must both be in your mind, because you are the perceiver. 
³They must also be in his, because you are perceiving him. 
⁴See him through the Holy Spirit in his mind, and you will recognise Him in yours. 
⁵What you acknowledge in your brother you are acknowledging in yourself, and what you share you strengthen.

4. The Voice of the Holy Spirit is weak in you. 
²That is why you must share It. 
³It must be increased in strength before you can hear It. 
⁴It is impossible to hear It in yourself while It is so weak in your mind. 
⁵It is not weak in Itself, but It is limited by your unwillingness to hear It. 
⁶If you make the mistake of looking for the Holy Spirit in yourself alone your thoughts will frighten you because, by adopting the ego’s viewpoint, you are undertaking an ego-alien journey with the ego as guide. 
⁷This is bound to produce fear.

5. Delay is of the ego, because time is its concept. 
²Both time and delay are meaningless in eternity. 
³I have said before that the Holy Spirit is God’s Answer to the ego. 
⁴Everything of which the Holy Spirit reminds you is in direct opposition to the ego’s notions, because true and false perceptions are themselves opposed. 
⁵The Holy Spirit has the task of undoing what the ego has made. 
⁶He undoes it at the same level on which the ego operates, or the mind would be unable to understand the change.

²So it is with the ego and the Holy Spirit; with time and eternity. 
³Eternity is an idea of God, so the Holy Spirit understands it perfectly. 
⁴Time is a belief of the ego, so the lower mind, which is the ego’s domain, accepts it without question. 
⁵The only aspect of time that is eternal is *now*.

³His ability to look beyond symbols into eternity enables Him to understand the laws of God, for which He speaks.
