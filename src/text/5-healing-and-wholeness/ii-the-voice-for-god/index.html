<p>
1. Healing is not creating; it is reparation. 
²The Holy Spirit promotes healing by looking beyond it to what the children of God were before healing was needed, and will be when they have been healed. 
³This alteration of the time sequence should be quite familiar, because it is very similar to the shift in the perception of time that the miracle introduces. 
⁴The Holy Spirit is the motivation for miracle-mindedness; the decision to heal the separation by letting it go. 
⁵Your will is still in you because God placed it in your mind, and although you can keep it asleep you cannot obliterate it. 
⁶God Himself keeps your will alive by transmitting it from His Mind to yours as long as there is time. 
⁷The miracle itself is a reflection of this union of Will between Father and Son.

<p>
2. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of joy. 
²He is the Call to return with which God blessed the minds of His separated Sons. 
³This is the vocation of the mind. 
⁴The mind had no calling until the separation, because before that it had only being, and would not have understood the Call to right thinking. 
⁵The Holy Spirit is God’s Answer to the separation; the means by which the Atonement heals until the whole mind returns to creating.

<p>
3. The principle of Atonement and the separation began at the same time. 
²When the ego was made, God placed in the mind the Call to joy. 
³This Call is so strong that the ego always dissolves at Its sound. 
⁴That is why you must choose to hear one of two voices within you. 
⁵One you made yourself, and that one is not of God. 
⁶But the other is given you by God, Who asks you only to listen to it. 
⁷The Holy Spirit is in you in a very literal sense. 
⁸His is the Voice that calls you back to where you were before and will be again. 
⁹It is possible even in this world to hear only that Voice and no other. 
¹⁰It takes effort and great willingness to learn. 
¹¹It is the final lesson that I learned, and God’s Sons are as equal as learners as they are as sons.

<p>
4. You <em>are</em> the Kingdom of Heaven, but you have let the belief in darkness enter your mind and so you need a new light. 
²The Holy Spirit is the radiance that you must let banish the idea of darkness. 
³His is the glory before which dissociation falls away, and the Kingdom of Heaven breaks through into its own. 
⁴Before the separation you did not need guidance. 
⁵You knew as you will know again, but as you do not know now.

<p>
5. God does not guide, because He can share only perfect knowledge. 
²Guidance is evaluative, because it implies there is a right way and also a wrong way, one to be chosen and the other to be avoided. 
³By choosing one you give up the other. 
⁴The choice for the Holy Spirit is the choice for God. 
⁵God is not in you in a literal sense: you are part of Him. 
⁶When you chose to leave Him He gave you a Voice to speak for Him because He could no longer share His knowledge with you without hindrance. 
⁷Direct communication was broken because you had made another voice.

<p>
6. The Holy Spirit calls you both to remember and to forget. 
²You have chosen to be in a state of opposition in which opposites are possible. 
³As a result, there are choices you must make. 
⁴In the holy state the will is free, so that its creative power is unlimited and choice is meaningless. 
⁵Freedom to choose is the same power as freedom to create, but its application is different. 
⁶Choosing depends on a split mind. 
⁷The Holy Spirit is one way of choosing. 
⁸God did not leave His children comfortless, even though they chose to leave Him. 
⁹The voice they put in their minds was not the Voice for His Will, for which the Holy Spirit speaks.

<p>
7. The Voice of the Holy Spirit does not command, because It is incapable of arrogance. 
²It does not demand, because It does not seek control. 
³It does not overcome, because It does not attack. 
⁴It merely reminds. 
⁵It is compelling only because of what It reminds you <em>of</em>. 
⁶It brings to your mind the other way, remaining quiet even in the midst of the turmoil you may make. 
⁷The Voice for God is always quiet, because It speaks of peace. 
⁸Peace is stronger than war because it heals. 
⁹War is division, not increase. 
¹⁰No one gains from strife. 
¹¹What profits it a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul? 
¹²If you listen to the wrong voice you <em>have</em> lost sight of your soul. 
¹³You cannot lose it, but you can not know it. 
¹⁴It is therefore “lost” to you until you choose right.

<p>
8. The Holy Spirit is your Guide in choosing. 
²He is in the part of your mind that always speaks for the right choice, because He speaks for God. 
³He is your remaining communication with God, which you can interrupt but cannot destroy. 
⁴The Holy Spirit is the way in which God’s Will is done on earth as it is in Heaven. 
⁵Both Heaven and earth are in you, because the call of both is in your mind. 
⁶The Voice for God comes from your own altars to Him. 
⁷These altars are not things; they are devotions. 
⁸Yet you have other devotions now. 
⁹Your divided devotion has given you the two voices, and you must choose at which altar you want to serve. 
¹⁰The call you answer now is an evaluation because it is a decision. 
¹¹The decision is very simple. 
¹²It is made on the basis of which call is worth more to you.

<p>
9. My mind will always be like yours, because we were created as equals. 
²It was only my decision that gave me all power in Heaven and earth. 
³My only gift to you is to help you make the same decision. 
⁴This decision is the choice to share it, because the decision itself <em>is</em> the decision to share. 
⁵It is made by giving, and is therefore the one choice that resembles true creation. 
⁶I am your model for decision. 
⁷By deciding for God I showed you that this decision can be made, and that you can make it.

<p>
10. I have assured you that the Mind that decided for me is also in you, and that you can let it change you just as it changed me. 
²This Mind is unequivocal, because it hears only one Voice and answers in only one way. 
³You are the light of the world with me. 
⁴Rest does not come from sleeping but from waking. 
⁵The Holy Spirit is the Call to awaken and be glad. 
⁶The world is very tired, because it is the idea of weariness. 
⁷Our task is the joyous one of waking it to the Call for God. 
⁸Everyone will answer the Call of the Holy Spirit, or the Sonship cannot be as One. 
⁹What better vocation could there be for any part of the Kingdom than to restore it to the perfect integration that can make it whole? 
¹⁰Hear only this through the Holy Spirit within you, and teach your brothers to listen as I am teaching you.

<p>
11. When you are tempted by the wrong voice, call on me to remind you how to heal by sharing my decision and making it stronger. 
²As we share this goal, we increase its power to attract the whole Sonship, and to bring it back into the oneness in which it was created. 
³Remember that “yoke” means “join together”, and “burden” means “message”. 
⁴Let us restate “My yoke is easy and my burden light” in this way: “Let us join together, for my message is light”.

<p>
12. I have enjoined you to behave as I behaved, but we must respond to the same Mind to do this. 
²This Mind is the Holy Spirit, Whose Will is for God always. 
³He teaches you how to keep me as the model for your thought, and to behave like me as a result. 
⁴The power of our joint motivation is beyond belief, but not beyond accomplishment. 
⁵What we can accomplish together has no limits, because the Call for God is the Call to the unlimited. 
⁶Child of God, my message is for you, to hear and give away as you answer the Holy Spirit within you.
