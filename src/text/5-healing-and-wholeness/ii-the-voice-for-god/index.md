1. Healing is not creating; it is reparation. 
The Holy Spirit promotes healing by looking beyond it to what the children of God were before healing was needed, and will be when they have been healed. 
This alteration of the time sequence should be quite familiar, because it is very similar to the shift in the perception of time that the miracle introduces. 
The Holy Spirit is the motivation for miracle-mindedness; the decision to heal the separation by letting it go. 
Your will is still in you because God placed it in your mind, and although you can keep it asleep you cannot obliterate it. 
God Himself keeps your will alive by transmitting it from His Mind to yours as long as there is time. 
The miracle itself is a reflection of this union of Will between Father and Son.

2. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of joy. 
He is the Call to return with which God blessed the minds of His separated Sons. 
This is the vocation of the mind. 
The mind had no calling until the separation, because before that it had only being, and would not have understood the Call to right thinking. 
The Holy Spirit is God’s Answer to the separation; the means by which the Atonement heals until the whole mind returns to creating.

3. The principle of Atonement and the separation began at the same time. 
When the ego was made, God placed in the mind the Call to joy. 
This Call is so strong that the ego always dissolves at Its sound. 
That is why you must choose to hear one of two voices within you. 
One you made yourself, and that one is not of God. 
But the other is given you by God, Who asks you only to listen to it. 
The Holy Spirit is in you in a very literal sense. 
His is the Voice that calls you back to where you were before and will be again. 
It is possible even in this world to hear only that Voice and no other. 
It takes effort and great willingness to learn. 
It is the final lesson that I learned, and God’s Sons are as equal as learners as they are as sons.

The Holy Spirit is the radiance that you must let banish the idea of darkness. 
His is the glory before which dissociation falls away, and the Kingdom of Heaven breaks through into its own. 
Before the separation you did not need guidance. 
You knew as you will know again, but as you do not know now.

5. God does not guide, because He can share only perfect knowledge. 
Guidance is evaluative, because it implies there is a right way and also a wrong way, one to be chosen and the other to be avoided. 
By choosing one you give up the other. 
The choice for the Holy Spirit is the choice for God. 
God is not in you in a literal sense: you are part of Him. 
When you chose to leave Him He gave you a Voice to speak for Him because He could no longer share His knowledge with you without hindrance. 
Direct communication was broken because you had made another voice.

6. The Holy Spirit calls you both to remember and to forget. 
You have chosen to be in a state of opposition in which opposites are possible. 
As a result, there are choices you must make. 
In the holy state the will is free, so that its creative power is unlimited and choice is meaningless. 
Freedom to choose is the same power as freedom to create, but its application is different. 
Choosing depends on a split mind. 
The Holy Spirit is one way of choosing. 
God did not leave His children comfortless, even though they chose to leave Him. 
The voice they put in their minds was not the Voice for His Will, for which the Holy Spirit speaks.

7. The Voice of the Holy Spirit does not command, because It is incapable of arrogance. 
It does not demand, because It does not seek control. 
It does not overcome, because It does not attack. 
It merely reminds. 
It is compelling only because of what It reminds you *of*. 
It brings to your mind the other way, remaining quiet even in the midst of the turmoil you may make. 
The Voice for God is always quiet, because It speaks of peace. 
Peace is stronger than war because it heals. 
War is division, not increase. 
No one gains from strife. 
What profits it a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul? 
If you listen to the wrong voice you *have* lost sight of your soul. 
You cannot lose it, but you can not know it. 
It is therefore ‘lost’ to you until you choose right.

(2–3, 6–7) At the same time the gospel emphasises the importance of our decision [to turn our minds back to God], it emphasises the power of our mind. The “power of Heaven and earth” that belongs to Jesus he offers us, once we choose to share our life with him (and [12:3](#12). (Wapnick, FAJ, p.237)

(6–7) …we take him as our model for learning. This certainly does not mean that we need to be crucified as he was, but rather that we identify with the meaning of his death; namely, when we find ourselves tempted to feel that we are unfairly treated, the innocent victims of what the world has done to us, we should recall Jesus’ example and ask his help. (also [12:1–3](#12), [T-6.in.2:1](/text/6-the-lessons-of-love/in-introduction/#2), [T-6.I.7:2](/text/6-the-lessons-of-love/i-the-message-of-the-crucifixion/#7); [8:6–7(/text/6-the-lessons-of-love/i-the-message-of-the-crucifixion/#8)]) (Wapnick, ATG, p.127)

I have enjoined you to behave as I behaved, but we must respond to the same Mind to do behave the same way. 
The Mind to which we must respond is the Holy Spirit; the-Holy-Spirit’s Will is for God always. 
The Holy Spirit teaches you how to keep me as the model for your thought, and to behave like me as a result. 
The power of our joint motivation is beyond belief, but not beyond accomplishment. 
What we can accomplish together has no limits, because the Call for God is the Call to the unlimited. 
Child of God, my message is for you, to hear and give away as you answer the Holy Spirit within you.
