1. Healing is not creating; it is reparation. 
²The Holy Spirit promotes healing by looking beyond it to what the children of God were before healing was needed, and will be when they have been healed. 
³This alteration of the time sequence should be quite familiar, because it is very similar to the shift in the perception of time that the miracle introduces. 
⁴The Holy Spirit is the motivation for miracle-mindedness; the decision to heal the separation by letting it go. 
⁵Your will is still in you because God placed it in your mind, and although you can keep it asleep you cannot obliterate it. 
⁶God Himself keeps your will alive by transmitting it from His Mind to yours as long as there is time. 
⁷The miracle itself is a reflection of this union of Will between Father and Son.

3. The principle of Atonement and the separation began at the same time. 
²When the ego was made, God placed in the mind the Call to joy. 
³This Call is so strong that the ego always dissolves at Its sound. 
⁴That is why you must choose to hear one of two voices within you. 
⁵One you made yourself, and that one is not of God. 
⁶But the other is given you by God, Who asks you only to listen to it. 
⁷The Holy Spirit is in you in a very literal sense. 
⁸His is the Voice that calls you back to where you were before and will be again. 
⁹It is possible even in this world to hear only that Voice and no other. 
¹⁰It takes effort and great willingness to learn. 
¹¹It is the final lesson that I learned, and God’s Sons are as equal as learners as they are as sons.

⁴In the holy state the will is free, so that its creative power is unlimited and choice is meaningless. 
⁵Freedom to choose is the same power as freedom to create, but its application is different. 
⁶Choosing depends on a split mind. 
⁷The Holy Spirit is one way of choosing. 
⁸God did not leave His children comfortless, even though they chose to leave Him. 
⁹The voice they put in their minds was not the Voice for His Will, for which the Holy Spirit speaks.

(2–3, 6–7) At the same time the gospel emphasises the importance of our decision [to turn our minds back to God], it emphasises the power of our mind. The “power of Heaven and earth” that belongs to Jesus he offers us, once we choose to share our life with him (and [12:3](#12). (Wapnick, FAJ, p.237)

(6–7) …we take him as our model for learning. This certainly does not mean that we need to be crucified as he was, but rather that we identify with the meaning of his death; namely, when we find ourselves tempted to feel that we are unfairly treated, the innocent victims of what the world has done to us, we should recall Jesus’ example and ask his help. (also [12:1–3](#12), [T-6.in.2:1](/text/6-the-lessons-of-love/in-introduction/#2), [T-6.I.7:2](/text/6-the-lessons-of-love/i-the-message-of-the-crucifixion/#7); [8:6–7(/text/6-the-lessons-of-love/i-the-message-of-the-crucifixion/#8)]) (Wapnick, ATG, p.127)
