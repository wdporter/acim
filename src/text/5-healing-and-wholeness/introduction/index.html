<p>
1. To heal is to make happy. 
²I have told you to think how many opportunities you have had to gladden yourself, and how many you have refused. 
³This is the same as telling you that you have refused to heal yourself. 
⁴The light that belongs to you is the light of joy. 
⁵Radiance is not associated with sorrow. 
⁶Joy calls forth an integrated willingness to share it, and promotes the mind’s natural impulse to respond as one. 
⁷Those who attempt to heal without being wholly joyous themselves call forth different kinds of responses at the same time, and thus deprive others of the joy of responding wholeheartedly.

<p>
2. To be wholehearted you must be happy. 
²If fear and love cannot coexist, and if it is impossible to be wholly fearful and remain alive, the only possible whole state is that of love. 
³There is no difference between love and joy. 
⁴Therefore, the only possible whole state is the wholly joyous. 
⁵To heal or to make joyous is therefore the same as to integrate and to make one. 
⁶That is why it makes no difference to what part or by what part of the Sonship the healing is offered. 
⁷Every part benefits, and benefits equally.

<p>
3. You are being blessed by every beneficent thought of any of your brothers anywhere. 
²You should want to bless them in return, out of gratitude. 
³You need not know them individually, or they you. 
⁴The light is so strong that it radiates throughout the Sonship and returns thanks to the Father for radiating His joy upon it. 
⁵Only God’s holy children are worthy channels of His beautiful joy, because only they are beautiful enough to hold it by sharing it. 
⁶It is impossible for a child of God to love his neighbor except as himself. 
⁷That is why the healer’s prayer is:

<p class="italic indent">
⁸Let me know this brother as I know myself.
