<p>
1. The creative power of God and His creations is limitless, but they are not in reciprocal relationship. 
²You communicate fully with God, as He does with you. 
³This is an ongoing process in which you share, and because you share it, you are inspired to create like God.
⁴Yet in creation you are not in a reciprocal relation to God, since He created you but you did not create Him.
⁵I have already told you that only in this respect your creative power differs from His.
⁶Even in this world there is a parallel. 
⁷Parents give birth to children, but children do not give birth to parents. 
⁸They do, however, give birth to their children, and thus give birth as their parents do.

<p>
2. If you created God and He created you, the Kingdom could not increase through its own creative thought. 
²Creation would therefore be limited, and you would not be cocreator with God. 
³As God’s creative Thought proceeds from Him to you, so must your creative thought proceed from you to your creations. 
⁴Only in this way can all creative power extend outward. 
⁵God’s accomplishments are not yours, but yours are like His. 
⁶He created the Sonship and you increase it. 
⁷You have the power to add to the Kingdom, though not to add to the Creator of the Kingdom. 
⁸You claim this power when you become vigilant only for God and His Kingdom. 
⁹By accepting this power as yours you have learned to remember what you are.

<p>
3. Your creations belong in you, as you belong in God. 
²You are part of God, as your sons are part of His Sons. 
³To create is to love. 
⁴Love extends outward simply because it cannot be contained. 
⁵Being limitless it does not stop. 
⁶It creates forever, but not in time. 
⁷God’s creations have always been, because He has always been. 
⁸Your creations have always been, because you can create only as God creates. 
⁹Eternity is yours, because He created you eternal.

<p>
4. The ego, on the other hand, always demands reciprocal rights, because it is competitive rather than loving. 
²It is always willing to strike a bargain, but it cannot understand that to be like another means that no bargains are possible. 
³To gain you must give, not bargain. 
⁴To bargain is to limit giving, and this is not God's Will. 
⁵To will with God is to create like Him. 
⁶God does not limit His gifts in any way. 
⁷You <em>are</em> His gifts, and so your gifts must be like His. 
⁸Your gifts to the Kingdom must be like His gifts to you.

<p>
5. I gave only love to the Kingdom because I believed that was what I was. 
²What you believe you are determines your gifts, and if God created you by extending Himself as you, you can only extend yourself as He did. 
³Only joy increases forever, since joy and eternity are inseparable. 
⁴God extends outward beyond limits and beyond time, and you who are cocreator with Him extend His Kingdom forever and beyond limit. 
⁵Eternity is the indelible stamp of creation. 
⁶The eternal are in peace and joy forever.

<p>
6. To think like God is to share His certainty of what you are, and to create like Him is to share the perfect Love He shares with you. 
²To this the Holy Spirit leads you, that your joy may be complete because the Kingdom of God is whole. 
³I have said that the last step in the reäwakening of knowledge is taken by God. 
⁴This is true, but it is hard to explain in words because words are symbols, and nothing that is true need be explained. 
⁵However, the Holy Spirit has the task of translating the useless into the useful, the meaningless into the meaningful, and the temporary into the timeless. 
⁶He can therefore tell you something about this last step.

<p>
7. God does not take steps, because His accomplishments are not gradual. 
²He does not teach, because His creations are changeless. 
³He does nothing last, because He created first and for always. 
⁴It must be understood that the word <q>first</q> as applied to Him is not a time concept. 
⁵He is first in the sense that He is the First in the Holy Trinity Itself. 
⁶He is the Prime Creator, because He created His cocreators. 
⁷Because He did, time applies neither to Him nor to what He created. 
⁸The <q>last step</q> that God will take was therefore true in the beginning, is true now, and will be true forever. 
⁹What is timeless is always there, because its being is eternally changeless. 
¹⁰It does not change by increase, because it was forever created to increase. 
¹¹If you perceive it as not increasing you do not know what it is. 
¹²You also do not know Who created it. 
¹³God does not reveal this to you because it was never hidden. 
¹⁴His light was never obscured, because it is His Will to share it. 
¹⁵How can what is fully shared be withheld and then revealed?
