  1. Truth can only <em>be</em> recognized and <em>need</em> only be recognized.
  ²Inspiration is of the Holy Spirit, and certainty is of God according to His laws.
  ³Both, therefore, come from the same Source, since inspiration comes from the Voice for God and certainty comes from the laws of God.
  ⁴Healing does not come directly from God, Who knows His creations as perfectly whole.
  ⁵Yet healing is still of God, because it proceeds from His Voice and from His laws.
  ⁶It is their result, in a state of mind that does not know Him.
  ⁷The state is unknown to Him and therefore does not exist, but those who sleep are unaware.
  ⁸Because they are unaware, they do not know.

  2. The Holy Spirit must work <em>through</em> you to teach you He is <em>in</em> you.
  ²This is an intermediary step toward the knowledge that you are in God because you are part of Him.
  ³The miracles the Holy Spirit inspires can have no order of difficulty, because every part of creation is of one order.
  ⁴This is God’s Will and yours.
  ⁵The laws of God establish this, and the Holy Spirit reminds you of it.
  ⁶When you heal, you are remembering the laws of God and forgetting the laws of the ego.
  ⁷I said before that forgetting is merely a way of remembering better.
  ⁸It is therefore not the opposite of remembering when it is properly perceived.
  ⁹Perceived improperly, it induces a perception of conflict with something else, as all incorrect perception does.
  ¹⁰Properly perceived, it can be used as a way out of conflict, as all proper perception can.

  3. The ego does not want to teach everyone all it has learned, because that would defeat its purpose.
  ²Therefore it does not really learn at all.
  ³The Holy Spirit teaches you to use what the ego has made, to teach the opposite of what the ego has <q>learned</q>. 
  ⁴The kind of learning is as irrelevant as is the particular ability that was applied to the learning. 
  ⁵All you need do is make the effort to learn, for the Holy Spirit has a unified goal for the effort. 
  ⁶If different abilities are applied long enough to one goal, the abilities themselves become unified. 
  ⁷This is because they are channelised in one direction, or in one way. 
  ⁸Ultimately, then, they all contribute to one result, and by so doing, their similarity rather than their differences is emphasised.
</p>

<p id=p4>
  4. All abilities should therefore be given over to the Holy Spirit, Who understands how to use them properly. 
  ²He uses them only for healing, because He knows you only as whole. 
  ³By healing you learn of wholeness, and by learning of wholeness you learn to remember God. 
  ⁴You have forgotten Him, but the Holy Spirit understands that your forgetting must be translated into a way of remembering.
</p>

<p id=p5>
  5. The ego’s goal is as unified as the Holy Spirit’s, and it is because of this that their goals can never be reconciled in any way or to any extent. 
  ²The ego always seeks to divide and separate. 
  ³The Holy Spirit always seeks to unify and heal. 
  ⁴As you heal you are healed, because the Holy Spirit sees no order of difficulty in healing. 
  ⁵Healing is the way to undo the belief in differences, being the only way of perceiving the Sonship as one. 
  ⁶This perception is therefore in accord with the laws of God, even in a state of mind that is out of accord with His. 
  ⁷The strength of right perception is so great that it brings the mind into accord with His, because it serves His Voice, which is in all of you.
</p>

<p id=p6>6. To think you can oppose the Will of God is a real delusion. 
  ²The ego believes that it can, and that it can offer you its own <q>will</q> as a gift. 
  ³<em>You do not want it</em>. 
  ⁴It is not a gift. 
  ⁵It is nothing at all. 
  ⁶God has given you a gift that you both <em>have</em> and <em>are</em>. 
  ⁷When you do not use it, you forget that you have it. 
  ⁸By not remembering it, you do not know what you are. 
  ⁹Healing, then, is a way of approaching knowledge by thinking in accordance with the laws of God, and recognising their universality. 
  ¹⁰Without this recognition, you have made the laws meaningless to you. 
  ¹¹Yet the laws are not meaningless, since all meaning is contained by them and in them.
</p>

<p id=p7>
  7. Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven, because that is where the laws of God operate truly, and they can operate only truly because they are the laws of truth. 
  ²But seek this only, because you can find nothing else. 
  ³There <em>is</em> nothing else. 
  ⁴God is All in all in a very literal sense. 
  ⁵All being is in Him Who is all Being. 
  ⁶You are therefore in Him since your being is His. 
  ⁷Healing is a way of forgetting the sense of danger the ego has induced in you, by not recognising its existence in your brother. 
  ⁸This strengthens the Holy Spirit in both of you, because it is a refusal to acknowledge fear. 
  ⁹Love needs only this invitation. 
  ¹⁰It comes freely to all the Sonship, being what the Sonship is. 
  ¹¹By your awakening to it, you are merely forgetting what you are not. 
  ¹²This enables you to remember what you are.
