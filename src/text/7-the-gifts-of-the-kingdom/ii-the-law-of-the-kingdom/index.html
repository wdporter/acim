<p>
  1. To heal is the only kind of thinking in this world that resembles the Thought of God, and because of the elements they share, can transfer easily to it.
  ²When a brother perceives himself as sick, he is perceiving himself as not whole, and therefore in need.
  ³If you, too, see him this way, you are seeing him as if he were absent from the Kingdom or separated from it, thus making the Kingdom itself obscure to both of you.
  ⁴Sickness and separation are not of God, but the Kingdom is.
  ⁵If you obscure the Kingdom, you are perceiving what is not of God.
</p>

<p>
  2. To heal, then, is to correct perception in your brother and yourself by sharing the Holy Spirit with him.
  ²This places you both within the Kingdom, and restores its wholeness in your mind.
  ³This reflects creation, because it unifies by increasing and integrates by extending.
  ⁴What you project or extend is real for you.
  ⁵This is an immutable law of the mind in this world as well as in the Kingdom.
  ⁶However, the content is different in this world, because the thoughts it governs are very different from the Thoughts in the Kingdom.
  ⁷Laws must be adapted to circumstances if they are to maintain order.
  ⁸The outstanding characteristic of the laws of mind as they operate in this world is that by obeying them, and I assure you that you must obey them, you can arrive at diametrically opposed results.
  ⁹This is because the laws have been adapted to the circumstances of this world, in which diametrically opposed outcomes seem possible because you can respond to two conflicting voices.
</p>

<p>
  3. Outside the Kingdom, the law that prevails inside is adapted to <q>What you project you believe</q>.
  ²This is its teaching form, because outside the Kingdom learning is essential.
  ³This form implies that you will learn what you are from what you have projected onto others, and therefore believe they are.
  ⁴In the Kingdom there is no teaching or learning, because there is no belief.
  ⁵There is only certainty.
  ⁶God and His Sons, in the surety of being, know that what you extend you are.
  ⁷That form of the law is not adapted at all, being the law of creation.
  ⁸God Himself created the law by creating <em>by</em> it.
  ⁹And His Sons, who create like Him, follow it gladly, knowing that the increase of the Kingdom depends on it, just as their own creation did.
</p>

<p>
  4. Laws must be communicated if they are to be helpful.
  ²In effect, they must be translated for those who speak different languages.
  ³Nevertheless, a good translator, although he must alter the form of what he translates, never changes the meaning.
  ⁴In fact, his whole purpose is to change the form so that the original meaning is retained.
  ⁵The Holy Spirit is the Translator of the laws of God to those who do not understand them.
  ⁶You could not do this yourself because a conflicted mind cannot be faithful to one meaning, and will therefore change the meaning to preserve the form.
</p>

<p>5. The Holy Spirit’s purpose in translating is exactly the opposite.
  ²He translates only to preserve the original meaning in all respects and in all languages.
  ³Therefore, He opposes the idea that differences in form are meaningful, emphasising always that <em>these differences do not matter</em>.
  ⁴The meaning of His message is always the same: only the meaning matters.
  ⁵God’s law of creation does not involve the use of truth to convince His Sons of truth.
  ⁶The extension of truth, which <em>is</em> the law of the Kingdom, rests only on the knowledge of what truth is.
  ⁷This is your inheritance and requires no learning at all, but when you disinherited yourself you became a learner of necessity.
</p>

<p>
  6. No one questions the connection of learning and memory.
  ²Learning is impossible without memory since it must be consistent to be remembered.
  ³That is why the Holy Spirit’s teaching is a lesson in remembering.
  ⁴I said before that He teaches remembering and forgetting, but the forgetting is only to make the remembering consistent.
  ⁵You forget in order to remember better.
  ⁶You will not understand His translations while you listen to two ways of interpreting them.
  ⁷Therefore you must forget or relinquish one to understand the other.
  ⁸This is the only way you can learn consistency, so that you can finally <em>be</em> consistent.
</p>

<p>
  7. What can the perfect consistency of the Kingdom mean to those who are confused?
  ²It is apparent that confusion interferes with meaning, and therefore prevents the learner from appreciating it.
  ³There is no confusion in the Kingdom, because there is only one meaning.
  ⁴This meaning comes from God and <em>is</em> God.
  ⁵Because it is also you, you share it and extend it as your Creator did.
  ⁶This needs no translation because it is perfectly understood, but it does need extension because it <em>means</em> extension.
  ⁷Communication is perfectly direct and perfectly united.
  ⁸It is totally free, because nothing discordant ever enters.
  ⁹That is why it is the Kingdom of God.
  ¹⁰It belongs to Him and is therefore like Him.
  ¹¹That is its reality, and nothing can assail it.
