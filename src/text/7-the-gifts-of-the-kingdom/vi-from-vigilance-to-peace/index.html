  1. Although you can love the Sonship only as one, you can perceive it as fragmented. 
  ²It is impossible, however, to see something in part of it that you will not attribute to all of it. 
  ³That is why attack is never discrete, and why it must be relinquished entirely. 
  ⁴If it is not relinquished entirely it is not relinquished at all. 
  ⁵Fear and love make or create, depending on whether the ego or the Holy Spirit begets or inspires them, but they <em>will</em> return to the mind of the thinker and they will affect his total perception. 
  ⁶That includes his concept of God, of His creations and of his own. 
  ⁷He will not appreciate any of Them if he regards Them fearfully. 
  ⁸He will appreciate all of Them if he regards Them with love.
</p>

<p id=p2>
  2. The mind that accepts attack cannot love. 
  ²That is because it believes it can destroy love, and therefore does not understand what love is. 
  ³If it does not understand what love is, it cannot perceive itself as loving. 
  ⁴This loses the awareness of being, induces feelings of unreality and results in utter confusion. 
  ⁵Your thinking has done this because of its power, but your thinking can also save you from this because its power is not of your making. 
  ⁶Your ability to direct your thinking as you choose is part of its power. 
  ⁷If you do not believe you can do this you have denied the power of your thought, and thus rendered it powerless in your belief.
</p>

<p id=p3>
  3. The ingeniousness of the ego to preserve itself is enormous, but it stems from the very power of the mind the ego denies. 
  ²This means that the ego attacks what is preserving it, which must result in extreme anxiety. 
  ³That is why the ego never recognizes what it is doing. 
  ⁴It is perfectly logical but clearly insane. 
  ⁵The ego draws upon the one source that is totally inimical to its existence <em>for</em> its existence. 
  ⁶Fearful of perceiving the power of this source, it is forced to depreciate it. 
  ⁷This threatens its own existence, a state which it finds intolerable. 
  ⁸Remaining logical but still insane, the ego resolves this completely insane dilemma in a completely insane way. 
  ⁹It does not perceive <em>its</em> existence as threatened by projecting the threat onto <em>you</em>, and perceiving your being as nonexistent. 
  ¹⁰This ensures its continuance if you side with it, by guaranteeing that you will not know your own safety.
</p>

<p id=p4>
  4. The ego cannot afford to know anything. 
  ²Knowledge is total, and the ego does not believe in totality. 
  ³This unbelief is its origin, and while the ego does not love you it <em>is</em> faithful to its own antecedents, begetting as it was begotten. 
  ⁴Mind always reproduces as it was produced. 
  ⁵Produced by fear, the ego reproduces fear. 
  ⁶This is its allegiance, and this allegiance makes it treacherous to love because you <em>are</em> love. 
  ⁷Love is your power, which the ego must deny. 
  ⁸It must also deny everything this power gives you <em>because</em> it gives you everything. 
  ⁹No one who has everything wants the ego. 
  ¹⁰Its own maker, then, does not want it. 
  ¹¹Rejection is therefore the only decision the ego could possibly encounter, if the mind that made it knew itself. 
  ¹²And if it recognized any part of the Sonship, it <em>would</em> know itself.
</p>

<p id=p5>
  5. The ego therefore opposes all appreciation, all recognition, all sane perception and all knowledge. 
  ²It perceives their threat as total, because it senses that all commitments the mind makes are total. 
  ³Forced, therefore, to detach itself from you, it is willing to attach itself to anything else. 
  ⁴But there <em>is</em> nothing else. 
  ⁵The mind can, however, make up illusions, and if it does so it will believe in them, because that is how it made them.
</p>

<p id=p6>
  6. The Holy Spirit undoes illusions without attacking them, because He cannot perceive them at all. 
  ²They therefore do not exist for Him. 
  ³He resolves the apparent conflict they engender by perceiving conflict as meaningless. 
  ⁴I have said before that the Holy Spirit perceives the conflict exactly as it is, and it <em>is</em> meaningless. 
  ⁵The Holy Spirit does not want you to understand conflict; He wants you to realise that, because conflict is meaningless, it is not understandable. 
  ⁶As I have already said, understanding brings appreciation and appreciation brings love. 
  ⁷Nothing else can be understood, because nothing else is real and therefore nothing else has meaning.
</p>

<p id=p7>
  7. If you will keep in mind what the Holy Spirit offers you, you cannot be vigilant for anything <em>but</em> God and His Kingdom. 
  ²The only reason you may find this hard to accept is because you may still think there is something else. 
  ³Belief does not require vigilance unless it is conflicted. 
  ⁴If it is, there are conflicting components within it that have led to a state of war, and vigilance has therefore become essential. 
  ⁵Vigilance has no place in peace. 
  ⁶It is necessary against beliefs that are not true, and would never have been called upon by the Holy Spirit if you had not believed the untrue. 
  ⁷When you believe something, you have made it true for you. 
  ⁸When you believe what God does not know, your thought seems to contradict His, and this makes it appear as if you are attacking Him.
</p>

<p id=p8>
  8. I have repeatedly emphasised that the ego does believe it can attack God, and tries to persuade you that you have done this. 
  ²If the mind cannot attack, the ego proceeds perfectly logically to the belief that you must be a body. 
  ³By not seeing you as you are, it can see itself as it wants to be. 
  ⁴Aware of its weakness the ego wants your allegiance, but not as you really are. 
  ⁵The ego therefore wants to engage your mind in its own delusional system, because otherwise the light of your understanding would dispel it. 
  ⁶It wants no part of truth, because the ego itself is not true. 
  ⁷If truth is total, the untrue cannot exist. 
  ⁸Commitment to either must be total; they cannot coëxist in your mind without splitting it. 
  ⁹If they cannot coëxist in peace, and if you want peace, you must give up the idea of conflict entirely and for all time. 
  ¹⁰This requires vigilance only as long as you do not recognize what is true. 
  ¹¹While you believe that two totally contradictory thought systems share truth, your need for vigilance is apparent.
</p>

<p id=p9>
  9. Your mind is dividing its allegiance between two kingdoms, and you are totally committed to neither. 
  ²Your identification with the Kingdom is totally beyond question except by you, when you are thinking insanely. 
  ³What you are is not established by your perception, and is not influenced by it at all. 
  ⁴Perceived problems in identification at any level are not problems of fact. 
  ⁵They are problems of understanding, since their presence implies a belief that what you are is up to you to decide. 
  ⁶The ego believes this totally, being fully committed to it. 
  ⁷It is not true. 
  ⁸The ego therefore is totally committed to untruth, perceiving in total contradiction to the Holy Spirit and to the knowledge of God.
</p>

<p id=p10>
  10. You can be perceived with meaning only by the Holy Spirit because your being <em>is</em> the knowledge of God. 
  ²Any belief you accept apart from this will obscure God’s Voice in you, and will therefore obscure God to you. 
  ³Unless you perceive His creation truly you cannot know the Creator, since God and His creation are not separate. 
  ⁴The Oneness of the Creator and the creation is your wholeness, your sanity and your limitless power. 
  ⁵This limitless power is God’s gift to you, because it is what you are. 
  ⁶If you dissociate your mind from it you are perceiving the most powerful force in the universe as if it were weak, because you do not believe you are part of it.
</p>

<p id=p11>
  11. Perceived without your part in it, God’s creation is seen as weak, and those who see themselves as weakened do attack. 
  ²The attack must be blind, however, because there is nothing to attack. 
  ³Therefore they make up images, perceive them as unworthy and attack them for their unworthiness. 
  ⁴That is all the world of the ego is. 
  ⁵Nothing. 
  ⁶It has no meaning. 
  ⁷It does not exist. 
  ⁸Do not try to understand it because, if you do, you are believing that it can be understood and is therefore capable of being appreciated and loved. 
  ⁹That would justify its existence, which cannot be justified. 
  ¹⁰You cannot make the meaningless meaningful. 
  ¹¹This can only be an insane attempt.
</p>

<p id=p12>
  12. Allowing insanity to enter your mind means that you have not judged sanity as wholly desirable. 
  ²If you want something else you will make something else, but because it is something else, it will attack your thought system and divide your allegiance. 
  ³You cannot create in this divided state, and you must be vigilant against this divided state because only peace can be extended. 
  ⁴Your divided mind is blocking the extension of the Kingdom, and its extension is your joy. 
  ⁵If you do not extend the Kingdom, you are not thinking with your Creator and creating as He created.
</p>

<p id=p13>
  13. In this depressing state the Holy Spirit reminds you gently that you are sad because you are not fulfilling your function as cocreator with God, and are therefore depriving yourself of joy. 
  ²This is not God’s choice but yours. 
  ³If your mind could be out of accord with God’s, you would be willing without meaning. 
  ⁴Yet because God’s Will is unchangeable, no conflict of will is possible. 
  ⁵This is the Holy Spirit’s perfectly consistent teaching. 
  ⁶Creation, not separation, is your will <em>because</em> it is God’s, and nothing that opposes this means anything at all. 
  ⁷Being a perfect accomplishment, the Sonship can only accomplish perfectly, extending the joy in which it was created, and identifying itself with both its Creator and its creations, knowing They are One.
