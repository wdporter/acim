1. If you cannot hear the Voice for God, it is because you do not choose to listen. 
That you *do* listen to the voice of your ego is demonstrated by your attitudes, your feelings and your behaviour. 
Yet this is what you want. 
This is what you are fighting to keep, and what you are vigilant to save. 
Your mind is filled with schemes to save the face of your ego, and you do not seek the face of Christ. 
The glass in which the ego seeks to see its face is dark indeed. 
How can it maintain the trick of its existence except with mirrors? 
But where you look to find yourself is up to you.

2. I have said that you cannot change your mind by changing your behaviour, but I have also said, and many times, that you *can* change your mind. 
When your mood tells you that you have chosen wrongly, and this is so whenever you are not joyous, then *know this need not be* 
In every case you have thought wrongly about some brother God created, and are perceiving images your ego makes in a darkened glass. 
Think honestly what you have thought that God would not have thought, and what you have not thought that God would have you think. 
Search sincerely for what you have done and left undone accordingly, and then change your mind to think with God’s. 
This may seem hard to do, but it is much easier than trying to think against it. 
Your mind is one with God’s. 
Denying this and thinking otherwise has held your ego together, but has literally split your mind. 
As a loving brother I am deeply concerned with your mind, and urge you to follow my example as you look at yourself and at your brother, and see in both the glorious creations of a glorious Father.

(9–10) The ego is aware of a power greater than itself, to which it owes its existence, and this power is the Son’s mind that has chosen — through what *I have termed* the decision maker — to believe in the ego’s thought system. The ego knows that at any moment the Son can withdraw its belief in it, and then it, and the thought system of separation that it represents will inevitably disappear. And this is the threat experienced by the ego. c/f [T-7.VII.4:6](/text/7-the-gifts-of-the-kingdom/vii-the-totality-of-the-kingdom/#p4), [5:1–2](/text/7-the-gifts-of-the-kingdom/vii-the-totality-of-the-kingdom/#5), [6:2–3](/text/7-the-gifts-of-the-kingdom/vii-the-totality-of-the-kingdom/#6) (Wapnick, AAC, p.33–34)

::: details Commentary
(1–3) These are very clear statements of the end of the ego, as well as Jesus’ statement that he is no different from us. The First Coming of Christ is not the birth of Jesus, but rather is the creation of the Sonship of which he is a part. It was then that the ego’s dream appeared to be born, necessitating the Atonement correction. When the Atonement is complete and the Sonship awakens from the dream, the Second Coming of Christ dawns. And Jesus is asking us to join in that process with him, which he “undertook to begin” ([T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles/#1)) (Wapnick, AVI, p.228)

(4) Jesus says he is in charge of the Atonement [T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles/#1), and the teacher’s manual states that the Holy Spirit established Jesus as the leader of the plan of the Atonement ([C-6.2:2](/clarification/6-the-holy-spirit/#2)). The meaning here is the same. Moreover, again, his judgement clearly lacks the implication of punishment or attack that is central to the traditional view. Jesus’ judgement is simply that the separation never happened, and so our pain and suffering not only is not warranted, but is inherently nonexistent, its cause of sin having been undone. Thus we are ‘protected’ from the ego’s thought system by the truth of the Atonement. (Wapnick, AVI, p.228–229)
