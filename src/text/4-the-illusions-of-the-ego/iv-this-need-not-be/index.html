<p>
1. If you cannot hear the Voice for God, it is because you do not choose to listen. 
²That you <em>do</em> listen to the voice of your ego is demonstrated by your attitudes, your feelings and your behaviour. 
³Yet this is what you want. 
⁴This is what you are fighting to keep, and what you are vigilant to save. 
⁵Your mind is filled with schemes to save the face of your ego, and you do not seek the face of Christ. 
⁶The glass in which the ego seeks to see its face is dark indeed. 
⁷How can it maintain the trick of its existence except with mirrors? 
⁸But where you look to find yourself is up to you.

<p>
2. I have said that you cannot change your mind by changing your behaviour, but I have also said, and many times, that you <em>can</em> change your mind. 
²When your mood tells you that you have chosen wrongly, and this is so whenever you are not joyous, then <em>know this need not be</em>. 
³In every case you have thought wrongly about some brother God created, and are perceiving images your ego makes in a darkened glass. 
⁴Think honestly what you have thought that God would not have thought, and what you have not thought that God would have you think. 
⁵Search sincerely for what you have done and left undone accordingly, and then change your mind to think with God’s. 
⁶This may seem hard to do, but it is much easier than trying to think against it. 
⁷Your mind is one with God’s. 
⁸Denying this and thinking otherwise has held your ego together, but has literally split your mind. 
⁹As a loving brother I am deeply concerned with your mind, and urge you to follow my example as you look at yourself and at your brother, and see in both the glorious creations of a glorious Father.

<p>
3. When you are sad, <em>know this need not be</em>. 
²Depression comes from a sense of being deprived of something you want and do not have. 
³Remember that you are deprived of nothing except by your own decisions, and then decide otherwise.

<p>
4. When you are anxious, realise that anxiety comes from the capriciousness of the ego, and <em>know this need not be</em>. 
²You can be as vigilant against the ego’s dictates as for them.

<p>
5. When you feel guilty, remember that the ego has indeed violated the laws of God, but <em>you</em> have not. 
²Leave the <q>sins</q> of the ego to me. 
³That is what Atonement is for. 
⁴But until you change your mind about those whom your ego has hurt, the Atonement cannot release you. 
⁵While you feel guilty your ego is in command, because only the ego can experience guilt. 
⁶<em>This need not be</em>.

<p>
6. Watch your mind for the temptations of the ego, and do not be deceived by it. 
²It offers you nothing. 
³When you have given up this voluntary dis-spiriting, you will see how your mind can focus and rise above fatigue and heal. 
⁴Yet you are not sufficiently vigilant against the demands of the ego to disengage yourself. 
⁵<em>This need not be</em>.

<p>
7. The habit of engaging with God and His creations is easily made if you actively refuse to let your mind slip away. 
²The problem is not one of concentration; it is the belief that no one, including yourself, is worth consistent effort. 
³Side with me consistently against this deception, and do not permit this shabby belief to pull you back. 
⁴The disheartened are useless to themselves and to me, but only the ego can <em>be</em> disheartened.

<p>
8. Have you really considered how many opportunities you have had to gladden yourself, and how many of them you have refused? 
²There is no limit to the power of a Son of God, but he can limit the expression of his power as much as he chooses. 
³Your mind and mine can unite in shining your ego away, releasing the strength of God into everything you think and do. 
⁴Do not settle for anything less than this, and refuse to accept anything but this as your goal. 
⁵Watch your mind carefully for any beliefs that hinder its accomplishment, and step away from them. 
⁶Judge how well you have done this by your own feelings, for this is the one right use of judgement. 
⁷Judgement, like any other defence, can be used to attack or protect; to hurt or to heal. 
⁸The ego <em>should</em> be brought to judgement and found wanting there. 
⁹Without your own allegiance, protection and love, the ego cannot exist. 
¹⁰Let it be judged truly and you must withdraw allegiance, protection and love from it.

<p>
9. You are a mirror of truth, in which God Himself shines in perfect light. 
²To the ego’s dark glass you need but say, <q>I will not look there because I know these images are not true</q>. 
³Then let the Holy One shine on you in peace, knowing that this and only this must be. 
⁴His Mind shone on you in your creation and brought your mind into being. 
⁵His Mind still shines on you and must shine through you. 
⁶Your ego cannot prevent Him from shining on you, but it can prevent you from letting Him shine through you.

<p>
10. The First Coming of Christ is merely another name for the creation, for Christ is the Son of God. 
²The Second Coming of Christ means nothing more than the end of the ego’s rule and the healing of the mind. 
³I was created like you in the First, and I have called you to join with me in the Second. 
⁴I am in charge of the Second Coming, and my judgement, which is used only for protection, cannot be wrong because it never attacks. 
⁵Yours may be so distorted that you believe I was mistaken in choosing you. 
⁶I assure you this is a mistake of your ego. 
⁷Do not mistake it for humility. 
⁸Your ego is trying to convince you that it is real and I am not, because if I am real, I am no more real than you are. 
⁹That knowledge, and I assure you that it <em>is</em> knowledge, means that Christ has come into your mind and healed it.

<p>
11. I do not attack your ego. 
²I do work with your higher mind, the home of the Holy Spirit, whether you are asleep or awake, just as your ego does with your lower mind, which is its home. 
³I am your vigilance in this, because you are too confused to recognise your own hope. 
⁴I am not mistaken. 
⁵Your mind will elect to join with mine, and together we are invincible. 
⁶You and your brother will yet come together in my name, and your sanity will be restored. 
⁷I raised the dead by knowing that life is an eternal attribute of everything that the living God created. 
⁸Why do you believe it is harder for me to inspire the disspirited or to stabilise the unstable? 
⁹I do not believe that there is an order of difficulty in miracles; you do. 
¹⁰I have called and you will answer. 
¹¹I understand that miracles are natural, because they are expressions of love. 
¹²My calling you is as natural as your answer, and as inevitable.
