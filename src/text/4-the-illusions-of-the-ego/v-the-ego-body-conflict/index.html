<p>
1. All things work together for good. 
²There are no exceptions except in the ego’s judgement. 
³The ego exerts maximal vigilance about what it permits into awareness, and this is not the way a balanced mind holds together. 
⁴The ego is thrown further off balance because it keeps its primary motivation from your awareness, and raises control rather than sanity to predominance. 
⁵The ego has every reason to do this, according to the thought system which gave rise to it and which it serves. 
⁶Sane judgement would inevitably judge against the ego, and must be obliterated by the ego in the interest of its self-preservation.

<p>
2. A major source of the ego’s off-balanced state is its lack of discrimination between the body and the Thoughts of God. 
²Thoughts of God are unacceptable to the ego, because they clearly point to the non-existence of the ego itself. 
³The ego therefore either distorts them or refuses to accept them. 
⁴It cannot, however, make them cease to be. 
⁵It therefore tries to conceal not only ‘unacceptable’ body impulses, but also the Thoughts of God, because both are threatening to it. 
⁶Being concerned primarily with its own preservation in the face of threat, the ego perceives them as the same. 
⁷By perceiving them as the same, the ego attempts to save itself from being swept away, as it would surely be in the presence of knowledge.

<p>
3. Any thought system that confuses God and the body must be insane. 
²Yet this confusion is essential to the ego, which judges only in terms of threat or non-threat to itself. 
³In one sense the ego’s fear of God is at least logical, since the idea of Him does dispel the ego. 
⁴But fear of the body, with which the ego identifies so closely, makes no sense at all.

<p>
4. The body is the ego’s home by its own election. 
²It is the only identification with which the ego feels safe, since the body’s vulnerability is its own best argument that you cannot be of God. 
³This is the belief that the ego sponsors eagerly. 
⁴Yet the ego hates the body, because it cannot accept it as good enough to be its home. 
⁵Here is where the mind becomes actually dazed. 
⁶Being told by the ego that it is really part of the body and that the body is its protector, the mind is also told that the body cannot protect it. 
⁷Therefore, the mind asks, <q>Where can I go for protection?</q>, to which the ego replies, <q>Turn to me</q>. 
⁸The mind, and not without cause, reminds the ego that it has itself insisted that it is identified with the body, so there is no point in turning to <em>it</em> for protection. 
⁹The ego has no real answer to this because there is none, but it does have a typical solution. 
¹⁰It obliterates the question from the mind’s awareness. 
¹¹Once out of awareness the question can and does produce uneasiness, but it cannot be answered because it cannot be asked.

<p>

5. This is the question that <em>must</em> be asked: <q>Where can I go for protection?</q>. 
²<q>Seek and ye shall find</q> does not mean that you should seek blindly and desperately for something you would not recognise. 
³Meaningful seeking is consciously undertaken, consciously organised and consciously directed. 
⁴The goal must be formulated clearly and kept in mind. 
⁵Learning and wanting to learn are inseparable. 
⁶You learn best when you believe what you are trying to learn is of value to you. 
⁷However, not everything you may want to learn has lasting value. 
⁸Indeed, many of the things you want to learn may be chosen <em>because</em> their value will not last.

<p>
6. The ego thinks it is an advantage not to commit itself to anything that is eternal, because the eternal must come from God. 
²Eternalness is the one function the ego has tried to develop, but has systematically failed to achieve. 
³The ego compromises with the issue of the eternal, just as it does with all issues touching on the real question in any way. 
⁴By becoming involved with tangential issues, it hopes to hide the real question and keep it out of mind. 
⁵The ego’s characteristic busyness with nonessentials is for precisely that purpose. 
⁶Preöccupations with problems set up to be incapable of solution are favourite ego devices for impeding learning progress. 
⁷In all these diversionary tactics, however, the one question that is never asked by those who pursue them is, <q>What for?</q>. 
⁸This is the question that <em>you</em> must learn to ask in connection with everything. 
⁹What is the purpose? 
¹⁰Whatever it is, it will direct your efforts automatically. 
¹¹When you make a decision of purpose, then, you have made a decision about your future effort; a decision that will remain in effect unless you change your mind.
