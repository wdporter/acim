1. It is reasonable to ask how the mind could ever have made the ego. 
In fact, it is the best question you could ask. 
There is, however, no point in giving an answer in terms of the past because the past does not matter, and history would not exist if the same errors were not being repeated in the present. 
Abstract thought applies to knowledge because knowledge is completely impersonal, and examples are irrelevant to its understanding. 
Perception, however, is always specific, and therefore quite concrete.

(1, 3) In other words, why should we persist in wondering how the ego occurred in the past, when we are still choosing it in the presnt? c/f [C-in.4](/clarification-of-terms/introduction/#4), [C-2.2:5–3:1](/clarification-of-terms/2-the-ego-the-miracle/#2). (Wapnick, LDNC, p.456)

2. Everyone makes an ego or a self for himself, which is subject to enormous variation because of its instability. 
He also makes an ego for everyone else he perceives, which is equally variable. 
Their interaction is a process that alters both, because they were not made by or with the Unalterable. 
It is important to realise that this alteration can and does occur as readily when the interaction takes place in the mind as when it involves physical proximity. 
Thinking about another ego is as effective in changing relative perception as is physical interaction. 
There could be no better example that the ego is only an idea and not a fact.

You make an ego for yourself. 
And you make an ego for everyone you perceive. 
Egos are unstable. 
When egos interact with each other, egos change. 
Egos can be changed just by thinking about them. 
By this we know ego is not a fact.

3. Your own state of mind is a good example of how the ego was made. 
When you threw knowledge away it is as if you never had it. 
This is so apparent that one need only recognise it to see that it does happen. 
If this occurs in the present, why is it surprising that it occurred in the past? 
Surprise is a reasonable response to the unfamiliar, though hardly to something that occurs with such persistence. 
But do not forget that the mind need not work that way, even though it does work that way now.

4. Think of the love of animals for their offspring, and the need they feel to protect them. 
That is because they regard them as part of themselves. 
No one dismisses something he considers part of himself. 
You reäct to your ego much as God does to His creations: with love, protection and charity. 
Your reäctions to the self you made are not surprising. 
In fact, they resemble in many ways how you will one day reäct to your real creations, which are as timeless as you are. 
The question is not how you respond to the ego, but what you believe you are. 
Belief is an ego function, and as long as your origin is open to belief you are regarding it from an ego viewpoint. 
When teaching is no longer necessary you will merely know God. 
Belief that there is another way of perceiving is the loftiest idea of which ego thinking is capable. 
That is because it contains a hint of recognition that the ego is not the Self.

5. Undermining the ego’s thought system must be perceived as painful, even though this is anything but true. 
Babies scream in rage if you take away a knife or scissors, although they may well harm themselves if you do not. 
In this sense you are still a baby. 
You have no sense of real self-preservation, and are likely to decide that you need precisely what would hurt you most. 
Yet whether or not you recognise it now, you have agreed to coöperate in the effort to become both harmless and helpful, attributes that must go together.

This will not last.

6. Only those who have a real and lasting sense of abundance can be truly charitable. 
This is obvious when you consider what is involved. 
To the ego, to give anything implies that you will have to do without it. 
When you associate giving with sacrifice, you give only because you believe that you are somehow getting something better, and can therefore do without the thing you give. 
‘Giving to get’ is an inescapable law of the ego, which always evaluates itself in relation to other egos. 
It is therefore continually preöccupied with the belief in scarcity that gave rise to it. 
Its whole perception of other egos as real is only an attempt to convince itself that *it* is real. 
‘Self-esteem’ in ego terms means nothing more than that the ego has deluded itself into accepting its reality, and is therefore temporarily less predatory. 
This ‘self-esteem’ is always vulnerable to stress, a term which refers to any perceived threat to the ego’s existence.

7. The ego literally lives by comparisons. 
Equality is beyond its grasp, and charity becomes impossible. 
The ego never gives out of abundance, because it was made as a substitute for it. 
That is why the concept of ‘getting’ arose in the ego’s thought system. 
Appetites are ‘getting’ mechanisms, representing the ego’s need to confirm itself. 
This is as true of body appetites as it is of the so-called ‘higher ego needs’. 
Body appetites are not physical in origin. 
The ego regards the body as its home, and tries to satisfy itself through the body. 
But the idea that this is possible is a decision of the mind, which has become completely confused about what is really possible.

8. The ego believes it is completely on its own, which is merely another way of describing how it thinks it originated. 
This is such a fearful state that it can only turn to other egos and try to unite with them in a feeble attempt at identification, or attack them in an equally feeble show of strength. 
It is not free, however, to open the premise to question, because the premise is its foundation.

While the ego is equally unaware of spirit, it does perceive itself as being rejected by something greater than itself. 
This is why self-esteem in ego terms must be delusional. 
The creations of God do not create myths, although creative effort can be turned to mythology. 
It can do so, however, only under one condition: what it makes is then no longer creative. 
Myths are entirely perceptual, and so ambiguous in form and characteristically good-and-evil in nature that the most benevolent of them is not without fearful connotations.

(6–7) How could God have given an Answer to a problem that the Course states clearly does not exist, and that God does even know about? …we can see the Course using language metaphorically, words that are not to be taken as literal truth. This is why we have spoken of the Course’s mythology, however psychologically sophisticated its form. God does not think, weep, nor give answers, any more than He makes things happen in the world, heal physical illness, nor end human suffering. These are metaphoric expressions Jesus (himself a symbol) uses in the Course to express the love of God that cannot be expressed except through such literary and anthropomorphic devices. c/f [T-18.VIII.1:7](/text/18-the-passing-of-the-dream/viii-the-little-garden.html/#1) (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 459) 

(It is not a universally held approach to interpretation that whatever does not fit one’s metaphysical view must be either myth, metaphor or symbol. If something needs to be explained away as myth, metaphor or symbol, then perhaps a reëxamination of one's assumptions is in order. —Ed.)

9. Myths and magic are closely associated, since myths are usually related to ego origins, and magic to the powers the ego ascribes to itself. 
Mythological systems generally include some account of ‘the creation’, and associate this with its particular form of magic. 
The so-called ‘battle for survival’ is only the ego’s struggle to preserve itself, and its interpretation of its own beginning. 
This beginning is usually associated with physical birth, because it is hard to maintain that the ego existed before that point in time. 
The more ‘religiously’ ego-oriented may believe that the soul existed before, and will continue to exist after a temporary lapse into ego life. 
Some even believe that the soul will be punished for this lapse. 
However, salvation does not apply to spirit, which is not in danger and does not need to be salvaged.

11. It cannot be emphasised too often that correcting perception is merely a temporary expedient. 
It is necessary only because misperception is a block to knowledge, while accurate perception is a stepping-stone towards it. 
The whole value of right perception lies in the inevitable realisation that *all* perception is unnecessary. 
This removes the block entirely. 
You may ask how this is possible as long as you appear to be living in this world. 
That is a reasonable question. 
You must be careful, however, that you really understand it. 
Who is the ‘you’ who are living in this world? 
Spirit is immortal, and immortality is a constant state. 
It is as true now as it ever was or ever will be, because it implies no change at all. 
It is not a continuum, nor is it understood by being compared to an opposite. 
Knowledge never involves comparisons. 
That is its main difference from everything else the mind can grasp.

It [correcting perception] is necessary only because misperception is a block to knowledge, while accurate perception is a stepping-stone towards it [knowledge]. 
The whole value of right perception lies in the inevitable realisation that *all* perception is unnecessary. 
This [realising all perception is unecessary] removes the block [to knowledge] entirely. 
You may ask how this [realising all perception is unnecessary] is possible as long as you appear to be living in this world. 
That [how is realising all perception is unnecessary] is a reasonable question. 
You must be careful, however, that you really understand it [the question]. 
Who is the ‘you’ who are living in this world? 
Spirit is immortal, and immortality is a constant state. 
It [immortality being a constant state] is as true now as it [immortality being a constant state] ever was or ever will be, because it [a constant state] implies no change at all. 
It [immortality] is not a continuum, nor is it [immortality] understood by being compared to an opposite. 
Knowledge never involves comparisons. 
That is its [knowledge’s] main difference from everything else the mind can grasp.

Correct perception to be free of misperception. 
The use accurate perception to gain knowledge. 
All perception is unnecessary. 
You are spirit, spirit is immortal, immortality does not change. 
Knowledge does not compare because there is no opposite to immortality.

(8) The ‘you’ who are the observer is outside of time and space, and therefore is outside of Crompond, New York, 1985. In other words, the ‘you’ who are the observer in the mind is not identical with the ‘you’ who are sitting here at this table. (Wapnick, AVI, p.37)

(8) He is teaching us that this ‘you’ is not our real Self at all, and that we have to be vigilant in recognising how the ego masks our true Identity that is held for us by the Holy Spirit. (Wapnick, AVI, p.205)
