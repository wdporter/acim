1. The Bible says that you should go with a brother twice as far as he asks. 
²It certainly does not suggest that you set him back on his journey. 
³Devotion to a brother cannot set you back either. 
⁴It can lead only to mutual progress. 
⁵The result of genuine devotion is inspiration, a word which properly understood is the opposite of fatigue. 
⁶To be fatigued is to be dis-spirited, but to be inspired is to be in the spirit. 
⁷To be egocentric is to be dis-spirited, but to be Self-centered in the right sense is to be inspired or in spirit. 
⁸The truly inspired are enlightened and cannot abide in darkness.

<p>
2. You can speak from the spirit or from the ego, as you choose. 
²If you speak from spirit you have chosen to <q>Be still and know that I am God</q>. 
³These words are inspired because they reflect knowledge. 
⁴If you speak from the ego you are disclaiming knowledge instead of affirming it, and are thus dis-spiriting yourself. 
⁵Do not embark on useless journeys, because they are indeed in vain. 
⁶The ego may desire them, but spirit cannot embark on them because it is forever unwilling to depart from its Foundation.

<p>
3. The journey to the cross should be the last ‘useless journey’. 
²Do not dwell upon it, but dismiss it as accomplished. 
³If you can accept it as your own last useless journey, you are also free to join my resurrection. 
⁴Until you do so your life is indeed wasted. 
⁵It merely reënacts the separation, the loss of power, the futile attempts of the ego at reparation, and finally the crucifixion of the body, or death. 
⁶Such repetitions are endless until they are voluntarily given up. 
⁷Do not make the pathetic error of ‘clinging to the old rugged cross’. 
⁸The only message of the crucifixion is that you can overcome the cross. 
⁹Until then you are free to crucify yourself as often as you choose. 
¹⁰This is not the gospel I intended to offer you. 
¹¹We have another journey to undertake, and if you will read these lessons carefully they will help prepare you to undertake it.
