<p>
1. It is hard to understand what <q>The Kingdom of Heaven is within you</q> really means. 
²This is because it is not understandable to the ego, which interprets it as if something outside is inside, and this does not mean anything. 
³The word <q>within</q> is unnecessary. 
⁴The Kingdom of Heaven <em>is</em> you. 
⁵What else <em>but</em> you did the Creator create, and what else <em>but</em> you is His Kingdom? 
⁶This is the whole message of the Atonement; a message which in its totality transcends the sum of its parts. 
⁷You, too, have a Kingdom that your spirit created. 
⁸It has not ceased to create because of the ego’s illusions. 
⁹Your creations are no more fatherless than you are. 
¹⁰Your ego and your spirit will never be cocreators, but your spirit and your Creator will always be. 
¹¹Be confident that your creations are as safe as you are.

<p class="italic indent">
¹²The Kingdom is perfectly united and perfectly protected, and the ego will not prevail against it. 
¹³Amen.

<p>
2. This is written in the form of a prayer because it is useful in moments of temptation. 
²It is a declaration of independence. 
³You will find it very helpful if you understand it fully. 
⁴The reason you need my help is because you have denied your own Guide and therefore need guidance. 
⁵My role is to separate the true from the false, so truth can break through the barriers the ego has set up and can shine into your mind. 
⁶Against our united strength the ego cannot prevail.

<p>
3. It is surely apparent by now why the ego regards spirit as its <q>enemy</q>. 
²The ego arose from the separation, and its continued existence depends on your continuing belief in the separation. 
³The ego must offer you some sort of reward for maintaining this belief. 
⁴All it can offer is a sense of temporary existence, which begins with its own beginning and ends with its own ending. 
⁵It tells you this life is your existence because it is its own. 
⁶Against this sense of temporary existence spirit offers you the knowledge of permanence and unshakable being. 
⁷No one who has experienced the revelation of this can ever fully believe in the ego again. 
⁸How can its meagre offering to you prevail against the glorious gift of God?

<p>
4. You who identify with your ego cannot believe God loves you. 
²You do not love what you made, and what you made does not love you. 
³Being made out of the denial of the Father, the ego has no allegiance to its maker. 
⁴You cannot conceive of the real relationship that exists between God and His creations because of your hatred for the self you made. 
⁵You project onto the ego the decision to separate, and this conflicts with the love you feel for the ego because you made it. 
⁶No love in this world is without this ambivalence, and since no ego has experienced love without ambivalence the concept is beyond its understanding. 
⁷Love will enter immediately into any mind that truly wants it, but it must want it truly. 
⁸This means that it wants it without ambivalence, and this kind of wanting is wholly without the ego’s <q>drive to get</q>.

<p>
5. There is a kind of experience so different from anything the ego can offer that you will never want to cover or hide it again. 
²It is necessary to repeat that your belief in darkness and hiding is why the light cannot enter. 
³The Bible gives many references to the immeasurable gifts which are for you, but for which you must ask. 
⁴This is not a condition as the ego sets conditions. 
⁵It is the glorious condition of what you are.

<p>
6. No force except your own will is strong enough or worthy enough to guide you. 
²In this you are as free as God, and must remain so forever. 
³Let us ask the Father in my name to keep you mindful of His Love for you and yours for Him. 
⁴He has never failed to answer this request, because it asks only for what He has already willed. 
⁵Those who call truly are always answered. 
⁶You shall have no other gods before Him because there <em>are</em> none.

<p>
7. It has never really entered your mind to give up every idea you ever had that opposes knowledge. 
²You retain thousands of little scraps of fear that prevent the Holy One from entering. 
³Light cannot penetrate through the walls you make to block it, and it is forever unwilling to destroy what you have made. 
⁴No one can see through a wall, but I can step around it. 
⁵Watch your mind for the scraps of fear, or you will be unable to ask me to do so. 
⁶I can help you only as our Father created us. 
⁷I will love you and honor you and maintain complete respect for what you have made, but I will not uphold it unless it is true. 
⁸I will never forsake you any more than God will, but I must wait as long as you choose to forsake yourself. 
⁹Because I wait in love and not in impatience, you will surely ask me truly. 
¹⁰I will come in response to a single unequivocal call.

<p>
8. Watch carefully and see what it is you are really asking for. 
²Be very honest with yourself in this, for we must hide nothing from each other. 
³If you will really try to do this, you have taken the first step toward preparing your mind for the Holy One to enter. 
⁴We will prepare for this together, for once He has come, you will be ready to help me make other minds ready for Him. 
⁵How long will you deny Him His Kingdom?

<p>
9. In your own mind, though denied by the ego, is the declaration of your release. 
²<em>God has given you everything</em>. 
³This one fact means the ego does not exist, and this makes it profoundly afraid. 
⁴In the ego’s language, <q>to have</q> and <q>to be</q> are different, but they are identical to the Holy Spirit. 
⁵The Holy Spirit knows that you both <em>have</em> everything and <em>are</em> everything. 
⁶Any distinction in this respect is meaningful only when the idea of <q>getting</q>, which implies a lack, has already been accepted. 
⁷That is why we make no distinction between <em>having</em> the Kingdom of God and <em>being</em> the Kingdom of God.

<p>
10. The calm being of God’s Kingdom, which in your sane mind is perfectly conscious, is ruthlessly banished from the part of the mind the ego rules. 
²The ego is desperate because it opposes literally invincible odds, whether you are asleep or awake. 
³Consider how much vigilance you have been willing to exert to protect your ego, and how little to protect your right mind. 
⁴Who but the insane would undertake to believe what is not true, and then protect this belief at the cost of truth?
