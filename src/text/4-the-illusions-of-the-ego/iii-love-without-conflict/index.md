1. It is hard to understand what “The Kingdom of Heaven is within you” really means. 
This is because it is not understandable to the ego, which interprets it as if something outside is inside, and this does not mean anything. 
The word ‘within’ is unnecessary. 
The Kingdom of Heaven *is* you. 
What else *but* you did the Creator create, and what else *but* you is His Kingdom? 
This is the whole message of the Atonement; a message which in its totality transcends the sum of its parts. 
You, too, have a Kingdom that your spirit created. 
It has not ceased to create because of the ego’s illusions. 
Your creations are no more fatherless than you are. 
Your ego and your spirit will never be co-creators, but your spirit and your Creator will always be. 
Be confident that your creations are as safe as you are.

>The Kingdom is perfectly united and perfectly protected, and the ego will not prevail against it. 
Amen.

It is a declaration of independence. 
You will find it very helpful if you understand it fully.

My role is to separate the true from the false, so truth can break through the barriers the ego has set up and can shine into your mind.

3. It is surely apparent by now why the ego regards spirit as its ‘enemy’. 
The ego arose from the separation, and its continued existence depends on your continuing belief in the separation. 
The ego must offer you some sort of reward for maintaining this belief. 
All it can offer is a sense of temporary existence, which begins with its own beginning and ends with its own ending. 
It tells you this life is your existence because it is its own. 
Against this sense of temporary existence spirit offers you the knowledge of permanence and unshakable being. 
No one who has experienced the revelation of this can ever fully believe in the ego again. 
How can its meagre offering to you prevail against the glorious gift of God?

4. You who identify with your ego cannot believe God loves you. 
You do not love what you made, and what you made does not love you. 
Being made out of the denial of the Father, the ego has no allegiance to its maker. 
You cannot conceive of the real relationship that exists between God and His creations because of your hatred for the self you made. 
You project onto the ego the decision to separate, and this conflicts with the love you feel for the ego because you made it. 
No love in this world is without this ambivalence, and since no ego has experienced love without ambivalence the concept is beyond its understanding. 
Love will enter immediately into any mind that truly wants it, but it must want it truly. 
This means that it wants it without ambivalence, and this kind of wanting is wholly without the ego’s ‘drive to get’.

5. There is a kind of experience so different from anything the ego can offer that you will never want to cover or hide it again. 
It is necessary to repeat that your belief in darkness and hiding is why the light cannot enter.

This is not a condition as the ego sets conditions.

You retain thousands of little scraps of fear that prevent the Holy One from entering. 
Light cannot penetrate through the walls you make to block it, and it is forever unwilling to destroy what you have made. 
No one can see through a wall, but I can step around it. 
Watch your mind for the scraps of fear, or you will be unable to ask me to do so. 
I can help you only as our Father created us. 
I will love you and honour you and maintain complete respect for what you have made, but I will not uphold it unless it is true. 
I will never forsake you any more than God will, but I must wait as long as you choose to forsake yourself. 
Because I wait in love and not in impatience, you will surely ask me truly. 
I will come in response to a single unequivocal call.

(1–2) …specifically address how Jesus sees his (or the Holy Spirit’s) role of looking with us at the ego’s darkness… Passages like these make no real sense, and  cannot truly be understood by students *unless* they first recognise the total unreality of all they perceive and experience. c/f [T-11.V.1:1–2:3,8–9](/text/11-god-or-the-ego/v-the-dynamics-of-the-ego/#1), [T-4.IV.2:4–6](/text/4-the-illusions-of-the-ego/iv-this-need-not-be/#2) (Wapnick, FCTL, p.130–131)

(1–2) Honesty with oneself regarding the investment in specialness is essential to the process of forgiveness, for it undoes denial and projection, the ego’s ‘double shield’ that protecs its guilt and therefore its own existence. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.181)

(1–3) …Jesus’ role in the Holy Spirit’s plan for our salvation is to help us draw away the ego’s veil that kept *its* plan of individuality, guilt, and mindlessness hidden from our awareness. Calling on his help reflects our little willngness finally to see within our minds the seeming terror we once believed was there, and which became protected by the world and the body. Reaching for Jesus’ hand means choosing to look at what our ego is up to, and has always been up to. Our choice for Jesus is born of the honesty to bring to him all our darkest thoughts and wishes. This would have to include, acknowledging the ego’s goal, the desire to kill even him, not to mention everyone else, in order to satisfy our craving for specialness and to ensure the continuation of our individuality. 

Our looking with Jesus therefore entails allowing ourselves finally to be aware — without judgement, fear or guilt — of the ugly murderousness that results from our need to protect and preserve our individual existence. This inherent selfishness of the separated self is not concerned with the cost of upholding individuality. As long as its craving for survival is satsified, moreover, it does not care who must pay the price, as long as it is not itself, and even if it means the seeming life of another. c/f [T-4.IV.2:4–6](/text/4-the-illusions-of-the-ego/iv-this-need-not-be/#2) (Wapnick, AAC, p. 191)

(2) …the ego … is able to distort the Course’s teachings sufficiently to allow its truth to be clouded over, protecting the ego’s belief system from ever being looked at openly and honestly. … we must openly look at these errors and bring them to his love *after* which they can be released. Without such honest examiniation, the truth will continue to be obstructed, and its light ‘forbidden’ entry into the hidden portals of the ego’s darkened mind, where it would surely heal our mistaken thoughts. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.588) 

(True enough, but be wary of the idea that if you don’t agree with Wapnick it’s because the ego is distorting the Course’s teachings –Ed.)
