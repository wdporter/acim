<p>
1. We have been emphasising perception, and have said very little about knowledge as yet. 
²This is because perception must be straightened out before you can know anything. 
³To know is to be certain. 
⁴Uncertainty means that you do not know. 
⁵Knowledge is power because it is certain, and certainty is strength. 
⁶Perception is temporary. 
⁷As an attribute of the belief in space and time, it is subject to either fear or love. 
⁸Misperceptions produce fear and true perceptions foster love, but neither brings certainty because all perception varies. 
⁹That is why it is not knowledge. 
¹⁰True perception is the basis for knowledge, but knowing is the affirmation of truth and beyond all perceptions.

<p>
2. All your difficulties stem from the fact that you do not recognise yourself, your brother or God. 
²To recognise means to ‘know again’, implying that you knew before. 
³You can see in many ways because perception involves interpretation, and this means that it is not whole or consistent. 
⁴The miracle, being a way of perceiving, is not knowledge. 
⁵It is the right answer to a question, but you do not question when you know. 
⁶Questioning illusions is the first step in undoing them. 
⁷The miracle, or the right answer, corrects them. 
⁸Since perceptions change, their dependence on time is obvious. 
⁹How you perceive at any given time determines what you do, and actions must occur in time. 
¹⁰Knowledge is timeless, because certainty is not questionable. 
¹¹You know when you have ceased to ask questions.

<p>
3. The questioning mind perceives itself in time, and therefore looks for future answers. 
²The closed mind believes the future and the present will be the same. 
³This establishes a seemingly stable state that is usually an attempt to counteract an underlying fear that the future will be worse than the present. 
⁴This fear inhibits the tendency to question at all.

<p>
4. True vision is the natural perception of spiritual sight, but it is still a correction rather than a fact. 
²Spiritual sight is symbolic, and therefore not a device for knowing. 
³It is, however, a means of right perception, which brings it into the proper domain of the miracle. 
⁴A ‘vision of God’ would be a miracle rather than a revelation. 
⁵The fact that perception is involved at all removes the experience from the realm of knowledge. 
⁶That is why visions, however holy, do not last.

<p>
5. The Bible tells you to know yourself, or to be certain. 
²Certainty is always of God. 
³When you love someone you have perceived him as he is, and this makes it possible for you to know him. 
⁴Until you first perceive him as he is you cannot know him. 
⁵While you ask questions about him you are clearly implying that you do not know God. 
⁶Certainty does not require action. 
⁷When you say you are acting on the basis of knowledge, you are really confusing knowledge with perception. 
⁸Knowledge provides the strength for creative thinking, but not for right doing. 
⁹Perception, miracles and doing are closely related. 
¹⁰Knowledge is the result of revelation and induces only thought. 
¹¹Even in its most spiritualised form perception involves the body. 
¹²Knowledge comes from the altar within and is timeless because it is certain. 
¹³To perceive the truth is not the same as to know it.

<p>
6. Right perception is necessary before God can communicate directly to His altars, which He established in His Sons. 
²There He can communicate His certainty, and His knowledge will bring peace without question. 
³God is not a stranger to His Sons, and His Sons are not strangers to each other. 
⁴Knowledge preceded both perception and time, and will ultimately replace them. 
⁵That is the real meaning of <q>Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end</q>, and <q>Before Abraham was, I am</q>. 
⁶Perception can and must be stabilised, but knowledge <em>is</em> stable. 
⁷<q>Fear God and keep His commandments</q> becomes ‘Know God and accept His certainty’.

<p>
7. If you attack error in another, you will hurt yourself. 
²You cannot know your brother when you attack him. 
³Attack is always made upon a stranger. 
⁴You are making him a stranger by misperceiving him, and so you cannot know him. 
⁵It is because you have made him a stranger that you are afraid of him. 
⁶Perceive him correctly so that you can know him. 
⁷There are no strangers in God’s creation. 
⁸To create as He created you can create only what you know, and therefore accept as yours. 
⁹God knows His children with perfect certainty. 
¹⁰He created them by knowing them. 
¹¹He recognises them perfectly. 
¹²When they do not recognise each other, they do not recognise Him.
