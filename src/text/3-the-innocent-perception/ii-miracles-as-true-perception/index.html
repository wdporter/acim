1. I have stated that the basic concepts referred to in this course are not matters of degree. 
²Certain fundamental concepts cannot be understood in terms of opposites. 
³It is impossible to conceive of light and darkness or everything and nothing as joint possibilities. 
⁴They are all true or all false. 
⁵It is essential that you realise your thinking will be erratic until a firm commitment to one or the other is made. 
⁶A firm commitment to darkness or nothingness, however, is impossible. 
⁷No one has ever lived who has not experienced <em>some</em> light and <em>some</em> thing. 
⁸No one, therefore, is able to deny truth totally, even if he thinks he can.

<p>
2. Innocence is not a partial attribute. 
²It is not real until it is total. 
³The partly innocent are apt to be quite foolish at times. 
⁴It is not until their innocence becomes a viewpoint with universal application that it becomes wisdom. 
⁵Innocent or true perception means that you never misperceive and always see truly. 
⁶More simply, it means that you never see what does not exist, and always see what does.

<p>
3. When you lack confidence in what someone will do, you are attesting to your belief that he is not in his right mind. 
²This is hardly a miracle-based frame of reference. 
³It also has the disastrous effect of denying the power of the miracle. 
⁴The miracle perceives everything as it is. 
⁵If nothing but the truth exists, right-minded seeing cannot see anything but perfection. 
⁶I have said that only what God creates or what you create with the same Will has any real existence. 
⁷This, then, is all the innocent can see. 
⁸They do not suffer from distorted perception.

<p>
4. You are afraid of God’s Will because you have used your own mind, which He created in the likeness of His Own, to miscreate. 
²The mind can miscreate only when it believes it is not free. 
³An <q>imprisoned</q> mind is not free because it is possessed, or held back, by itself. 
⁴It is therefore limited, and the will is not free to assert itself. 
⁵To be one is to be of one mind or will. 
⁶When the Will of the Sonship and the Father are One, their perfect accord is Heaven.

<p>
5. Nothing can prevail against a Son of God who commends his spirit into the Hands of his Father. 
²By doing this the mind awakens from its sleep and remembers its Creator. 
³All sense of separation disappears. 
⁴The Son of God is part of the Holy Trinity, but the Trinity Itself is One. 
⁵There is no confusion within Its Levels, because They are of one Mind and one Will. 
⁶This single purpose creates perfect integration and establishes the peace of God. 
⁷Yet this vision can be perceived only by the truly innocent. 
⁸Because their hearts are pure, the innocent defend true perception instead of defending themselves against it. 
⁹Understanding the lesson of the Atonement they are without the wish to attack, and therefore they see truly. 
¹⁰This is what the Bible means when it says, <q>When he shall appear (or be perceived) we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is</q>.

<p>
6. The way to correct distortions is to withdraw your faith in them and invest it only in what is true. 
²You cannot make untruth true. 
³If you are willing to accept what is true in everything you perceive, you let it be true for you. 
⁴Truth overcomes all error, and those who live in error and emptiness can never find lasting solace. 
⁵If you perceive truly you are cancelling out misperceptions in yourself and in others simultaneously. 
⁶Because you see them as they are, you offer them your acceptance of their truth so they can accept it for themselves. 
⁷This is the healing that the miracle induces.
