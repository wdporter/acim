<p>
1. I have said that the abilities you possess are only shadows of your real strength, and that perception, which is inherently judgmental, was introduced only after the separation. 
²No one has been sure of anything since. 
³I have also made it clear that the resurrection was the means for the return to knowledge, which was accomplished by the union of my will with the Father’s. 
⁴We can now establish a distinction that will clarify some of our subsequent statements.

<p>
2. Since the separation, the words <q>create</q> and <q>make</q> have become confused. 
²When you make something, you do so out of a specific sense of lack or need. 
³Anything made for a specific purpose has no true generalisability. 
⁴When you make something to fill a perceived lack, you are tacitly implying that you believe in separation. 
⁵The ego has invented many ingenious thought systems for this purpose. 
⁶None of them is creative. 
⁷Inventiveness is wasted effort even in its most ingenious form. 
⁸The highly specific nature of invention is not worthy of the abstract creativity of God’s creations. 

<p>
3. Knowing, as we have already observed, does not lead to doing. 
²The confusion between your real creation and what you have made of yourself is so profound that it has become literaly impossible for you to know anything. 
³Knowledge is always stable, and it is quite evident that you are not. 
⁴Nevertheless, you are perfectly stable as God created you. 
⁵In this sense, when your behavior is unstable, you are disagreeing with God’s idea of your creation. 
⁶You can do this if you choose, but you would hardly want to do it if you were in your right mind.

<p>
4. The fundamental question you continually ask yourself cannot properly be directed to yourself at all. 
²You keep asking what it is you are. 
³This implies that the answer is not only one you know, but is also one that is up to you to supply. 
⁴Yet you cannot perceive yourself correctly. 
⁵You have no image to be perceived. 
⁶The word <q>image</q> is always perception-related, and not a part of knowledge. 
⁷Images are symbolic and stand for something else. 
⁸The idea of <q>changing your image</q> recognizes the power of perception, but also implies that there is nothing stable to know.

<p>
5. Knowing is not open to interpretation. 
²You may try to <q>interpret</q> meaning, but this is always open to error because it refers to the <em>perception</em> of meaning. 
³Such incongruities are the result of attempts to regard yourself as separated and unseparated at the same time. 
⁴It is impossible to make so fundamental a confusion without increasing your overall confusion still further. 
⁵Your mind may have become very ingenious, but as always happens when method and content are separated, it is utilised in a futile attempt to escape from an inescapable impasse. 
⁶Ingenuity is totally divorced from knowledge, because knowledge does not require ingenuity. 
⁷Ingenious thinking is not the truth that shall set you free, but you are free of the need to engage in it when you are willing to let it go.

<p>
6. Prayer is a way of asking for something. 
²It is the medium of miracles. 
³But the only meaningful prayer is for forgiveness, because those who have been forgiven have everything. 
⁴Once forgiveness has been accepted, prayer in the usual sense becomes utterly meaningless. 
⁵The prayer for forgiveness is nothing more than a request that you may be able to recognize what you already have. 
⁶In electing perception instead of knowledge, you placed yourself in a position where you could resemble your Father only by perceiving miraculously. 
⁷You have lost the knowledge that you yourself are a miracle of God. 
⁸Creation is your Source and your only real function.

<p>
7. The statement <q>God created man in his own image and likeness</q> needs reinterpretation. 
²<q>Image</q> can be understood as <q>thought</q>, and <q>likeness</q> as <q>of a like quality</q>. 
³God did create spirit in His Own Thought and of a quality like to His Own. 
⁴There is nothing else. 
⁵Perception, on the other hand, is impossible without a belief in <q>more</q> and <q>less</q>. 
⁶At every level it involves selectivity. 
⁷Perception is a continual process of accepting and rejecting, organising and reörganising, shifting and changing. 
⁸Evaluation is an essential part of perception, because judgments are necessary in order to select.

<p>
8. What happens to perceptions if there are no judgments and nothing but perfect equality? 
²Perception becomes impossible. 
³Truth can only be known. 
⁴All of it is equally true, and knowing any part of it is to know all of it. 
⁵Only perception involves partial awareness. 
⁶Knowledge transcends the laws governing perception, because partial knowledge is impossible. 
⁷It is all one and has no separate parts. 
⁸You who are really one with it need but know yourself and your knowledge is complete. 
⁹To know God’s miracle is to know Him.

<p>
9. Forgiveness is the healing of the perception of separation. 
²Correct perception of your brother is necessary, because minds have chosen to see themselves as separate. 
³Spirit knows God completely. 
⁴That is its miraculous power. 
⁵The fact that each one has this power completely is a condition entirely alien to the world’s thinking. 
⁶The world believes that if anyone has everything, there is nothing left. 
⁷But God’s miracles are as total as His Thoughts because they are His Thoughts.

<p>
10. As long as perception lasts prayer has a place. 
²Since perception rests on lack, those who perceive have not totally accepted the Atonement and given themselves over to truth. 
³Perception is based on a separated state, so that anyone who perceives at all needs healing. 
⁴Communion, not prayer, is the natural state of those who know. 
⁵God and His miracle are inseparable. 
⁶How beautiful indeed are the Thoughts of God who live in His light! 
⁷Your worth is beyond perception because it is beyond doubt. 
⁸Do not perceive yourself in different lights. 
⁹Know yourself in the One Light where the miracle that is you is perfectly clear.
