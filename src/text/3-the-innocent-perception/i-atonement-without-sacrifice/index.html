³Many sincere Christians have misunderstood this.
⁴No one who is free of the belief in scarcity could possibly make this mistake. 
⁵If the crucifixion is seen from an upside-down point of view, it does appear as if God permitted and even encouraged one of His Sons to suffer because he was good. 
⁶This particularly unfortunate interpretation, which arose out of projection, has led many people to be bitterly afraid of God. 
⁷Such anti-religious concepts enter into many religions. 
⁸Yet the real Christian should pause and ask, “How could this be?”. 
⁹Is it likely that God Himself would be capable of the kind of thinking which His Own words have clearly stated is unworthy of His Son?

2. The best defense, as always, is not to attack another’s position, but rather to protect the truth. 
²It is unwise to accept any concept if you have to invert a whole frame of reference in order to justify it. 
³This procedure is painful in its minor applications and genuinely tragic on a wider scale. 
⁴Persecution frequently results in an attempt to “justify” the terrible misperception that God Himself persecuted His Own Son on behalf of salvation. 
⁵The very words are meaningless. 
⁶It has been particularly difficult to overcome this because, although the error itself is no harder to correct than any other, many have been unwilling to give it up in view of its prominent value as a defense. 
⁷In milder forms a parent says, “This hurts me more than it hurts you”, and feels exonerated in beating a child. 
⁸Can you believe our Father really thinks this way? 
⁹It is so essential that all such thinking be dispelled that we must be sure that nothing of this kind remains in your mind. 
¹⁰I was not “punished” because <em>you</em> were bad. 
¹¹The wholly benign lesson the Atonement teaches is lost if it is tainted with this kind of distortion in any form.
