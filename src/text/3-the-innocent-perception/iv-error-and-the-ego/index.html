<p>
1. The abilities you now possess are only shadows of your real strength. 
²All of your present functions are divided and open to question and doubt. 
³This is because you are not certain how you will use them, and are therefore incapable of knowledge. 
⁴You are also incapable of knowledge because you can still perceive lovelessly. 
⁵Perception did not exist until the separation introduced degrees, aspects and intervals. 
⁶Spirit has no levels, and all conflict arises from the concept of levels. 
⁷Only the Levels of the Trinity are capable of unity. 
⁸The levels created by the separation cannot but conflict. 
⁹This is because they are meaningless to each other.

<p>
2. Consciousness, the level of perception, was the first split introduced into the mind after the separation, making the mind a perceiver rather than a creator. 
²Consciousness is correctly identified as the domain of the ego. 
³The ego is a wrong-minded attempt to perceive yourself as you wish to be, rather than as you are. 
⁴Yet you can know yourself only as you are, because that is all you can be sure of. 
⁵Everything else <em>is</em> open to question.

<p>
3. The ego is the questioning aspect of the post-separation self, which was made rather than created. 
²It is capable of asking questions but not of perceiving meaningful answers, because these would involve knowledge and cannot be perceived. 
³The mind is therefore confused, because only One-mindedness can be without confusion. 
⁴A separated or divided mind <em>must</em> be confused. 
⁵It is necessarily uncertain about what it is. 
⁶It has to be in conflict because it is out of accord with itself. 
⁷This makes its aspects strangers to each other, and this is the essence of the fear-prone condition, in which attack is always possible. 
⁸You have every reason to feel afraid as you perceive yourself. 
⁹This is why you cannot escape from fear until you realise that you did not and could not create yourself. 
¹⁰You can never make your misperceptions true, and your creation is beyond your own error. 
¹¹That is why you must eventually choose to heal the separation.

<p>
4. Right-mindedness is not to be confused with the knowing mind, because it is applicable only to right perception. 
²You can be right-minded or wrong-minded, and even this is subject to degrees, clearly demonstrating that knowledge is not involved. 
³The term <q>right-mindedness</q> is properly used as the correction for <q>wrong-mindedness</q>, and applies to the state of mind that induces accurate perception. 
⁴It is miracle-minded because it heals misperception, and this is indeed a miracle in view of how you perceive yourself.

<p>
5. Perception always involves some misuse of mind, because it brings the mind into areas of uncertainty. 
²The mind is very active. 
³When it chooses to be separated it chooses to perceive. 
⁴Until then it wills only to know. 
⁵Afterwards it can only choose ambiguously, and the only way out of ambiguity is clear perception. 
⁶The mind returns to its proper function only when it wills to know. 
⁷This places it in the service of spirit, where perception is changed. 
⁸The mind chooses to divide itself when it chooses to make its own levels. 
⁹But it could not entirely separate itself from spirit, because it is from spirit that it derives its whole power to make or create. 
¹⁰Even in miscreation the mind is affirming its Source, or it would merely cease to be. 
¹¹This is impossible, because the mind belongs to spirit which God created and which is therefore eternal.

<p>
6. The ability to perceive made the body possible, because you must perceive <em>something</em> and <em>with</em> something. 
²That is why perception involves an exchange or translation, which knowledge does not need. 
³The interpretative function of perception, a distorted form of creation, then permits you to interpret the body as yourself in an attempt to escape from the conflict you have induced. 
⁴Spirit, which knows, could not be reconciled with this loss of power, because it is incapable of darkness. 
⁵This makes spirit almost inaccessible to the mind and entirely inaccessible to the body. 
⁶Thereäfter, spirit is perceived as a threat, because light abolishes darkness merely by showing you it is not there. 
⁷Truth will always overcome error in this way. 
⁸This cannot be an active process of correction because, as I have already emphasised, knowledge does not do anything. 
⁹It can be perceived as an attacker, but it cannot attack. 
¹⁰What you perceive as its attack is your own vague recognition that knowledge can always be remembered, never having been destroyed.

<p>
7. God and His creations remain in surety, and therefore know that no miscreation exists. 
²Truth cannot deal with errors that you want. 
³I was a man who remembered spirit and its knowledge. 
⁴As a man I did not attempt to counteract error with knowledge, but to correct error from the bottom up. 
⁵I demonstrated both the powerlessness of the body and the power of the mind. 
⁶By uniting my will with that of my Creator, I naturally remembered spirit and its real purpose. 
⁷I cannot unite your will with God’s for you, but I can erase all misperceptions from your mind if you will bring it under my guidance. 
⁸Only your misperceptions stand in your way. 
⁹Without them your choice is certain. 
¹⁰Sane perception induces sane choosing. 
¹¹I cannot choose for you, but I can help you make your own right choice. 
¹²<q>Many are called but few are chosen</q> should be, <q>All are called but few choose to listen</q>. 
¹³Therefore, they do not choose right. 
¹⁴The ’chosen ones’ are merely those who choose right sooner. 
¹⁵Right minds can do this now, and they will find rest unto their souls. 
¹⁶God knows you only in peace, and this <em>is</em> your reality.
