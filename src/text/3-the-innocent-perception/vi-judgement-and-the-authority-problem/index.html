<p>
1. We have already discussed the Last Judgment, but in insufficient detail. 
²After the Last Judgment there will be no more. 
³Judgment is symbolic because beyond perception there is no judgment. 
⁴When the Bible says “Judge not that ye be not judged”, it means that if you judge the reality of others you will be unable to avoid judging your own.

<p>
2. The choice to judge rather than to know is the cause of the loss of peace. 
²Judgment is the process on which perception but not knowledge rests. 
³I have discussed this before in terms of the selectivity of perception, pointing out that evaluation is its obvious prerequisite. 
⁴Judegment always involves rejection. 
⁵It never emphasizes only the positive aspects of what is judged, whether in you or in others. 
⁶What has been perceived and rejected, or judged and found wanting, remains in your mind because it has been perceived. 
⁷One of the illusions from which you suffer is the belief that what you judged against has no effect. 
⁸This cannot be true unless you also believe that what you judged against does not exist. 
⁹You evidently do not believe this, or you would not have judged against it. 
¹⁰In the end it does not matter whether your judgment is right or wrong. 
¹¹Either way you are placing your belief in the unreal. 
¹²This cannot be avoided in any type of judgment, because it implies the belief that reality is yours to select <em>from</em>.

<p>
3. You have no idea of the tremendous release and deep peace that comes from meeting yourself and your brothers totally without judgment. 
²When you recognize what you are and what your brothers are, you will realize that judging them in any way is without meaning. 
³In fact, their meaning is lost to you precisely <em>because</em> you are judging them. 
⁴All uncertainty comes from the belief that you are under the coercion of judgment. 
⁵You do not need judgment to organise your life, and you certainly do not need it to organise yourself. 
⁶In the presence of knowledge all judgment is automatically suspended, and this is the process that enables recognition to replace perception.

<p>
4. You are very fearful of everything you have perceived but have refused to accept. 
²You believe that, because you have refused to accept it, you have lost control over it. 
³This is why you see it in nightmares, or in pleasant disguises in what seem to be your happier dreams. 
⁴Nothing that you have refused to accept can be brought into awareness. 
⁵It is not dangerous in itself, but you have made it seem dangerous to you.

<p>
5. When you feel tired, it is because you have judged yourself as capable of being tired. 
²When you laugh at someone, it is because you have judged him as unworthy. 
³When you laugh at yourself you must laugh at others, if only because you cannot tolerate the idea of being more unworthy than they are. 
⁴All this makes you feel tired because it is essentially disheartening. 
⁵You are not really capable of being tired, but you are very capable of wearying yourself. 
⁶The strain of constant judgment is virtually intolerable. 
⁷It is curious that an ability so debilitating would be so deeply cherished. 
⁸Yet if you wish to be the author of reality, you will insist on holding on to judgment. 
⁹You will also regard judgment with fear, believing that it will someday be used against you. 
¹⁰This belief can exist only to the extent that you believe in the efficacy of judgment as a weapon of defense for your own authority.

<p>
6. God offers only mercy. 
²Your words should reflect only mercy, because that is what you have received and that is what you should give. 
³Justice is a temporary expedient, or an attempt to teach you the meaning of mercy. 
⁴It is judgmental only because you are capable of injustice.

<p>
7.  I have spoken of different symptoms, and at that level there is almost endless variation. 
²There is, however, only one cause for all of them: the authority problem. 
³This <em>is</em> “the root of all evil”. 
⁴Every symptom the ego makes involves a contradiction in terms, because the mind is split between the ego and the Holy Spirit, so that whatever the ego makes is incomplete and contradictory. 
⁵This untenable position is the result of the authority problem which, because it accepts the one inconceivable thought as its premise, can produce only ideas that are inconceivable.

<p>
8. The issue of authority is really a question of authorship. 
²When you have an authority problem, it is always because you believe you are the author of yourself and project your delusion onto others. 
³You then perceive the situation as one in which others are literally fighting you for your authorship. 
⁴This is the fundamental error of all those who believe they have usurped the power of God. 
⁵This belief is very frightening to them, but hardly troubles God. 
⁶He is, however, eager to undo it, not to punish His children, but only because He knows that it makes them unhappy. 
⁷God’s creations are given their true Authorship, but you prefer to be anonymous when you choose to separate yourself from your Author. 
⁸Being uncertain of your true Authorship, you believe that your creation was anonymous. 
⁹This leaves you in a position where it sounds meaningful to believe that you created yourself. 
¹⁰The dispute over authorship has left such uncertainty in your mind that it may even doubt whether you really exist at all.

 <p>
9. Only those who give over all desire to reject can know that their own rejection is impossible. 
²You have not usurped the power of God, but you <em>have</em> lost it. 
³Fortunately, to lose something does not mean that it has gone. 
⁴It merely means that you do not remember where it is. 
⁵Its existence does not depend on your ability to identify it, or even to place it. 
⁶It is possible to look on reality without judgment and merely know that it is there.

<p>
10. Peace is a natural heritage of spirit. 
²Everyone is free to refuse to accept his inheritance, but he is not free to establish what his inheritance is. 
³The problem everyone must decide is the fundamental question of authorship. 
⁴All fear comes ultimately, and sometimes by way of very devious routes, from the denial of Authorship. 
⁵The offence is never to God, but only to those who deny Him. 
⁶To deny His Authorship is to deny yourself the reason for your peace, so that you see yourself only in segments. 
⁷This strange perception <em>is</em> the authority problem.

<p>
11. There is no one who does not feel that he is imprisoned in some way. 
²If this is the result of his own free will he must regard his will as not free, or the circular reasoning in this position would be quite apparent. 
³Free will must lead to freedom. 
⁴Judgment always imprisons because it separates segments of reality by the unstable scales of desire. 
⁵Wishes are not facts. 
⁶To wish is to imply that willing is not sufficient. 
⁷Yet no one in his right mind believes that what is wished is as real as what is willed. 
⁸Instead of “Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven” say, “<em>Will</em> ye first the Kingdom of Heaven”, and you have said, “I know what I am and I accept my own inheritance”.
