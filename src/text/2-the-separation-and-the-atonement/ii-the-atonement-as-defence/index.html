<p>1. You can do anything I ask. 
²I have asked you to perform miracles, and have made it clear that miracles are natural, corrective, healing and universal. 
³There is nothing they cannot do, but they cannot be performed in the spirit of doubt or fear. 
⁴When you are afraid of anything, you are acknowledging its power to hurt you. 
⁵Remember that where your heart is, there is your treasure also. 
⁶You believe in what you value. 
⁷If you are afraid, you are valuing wrongly. 
⁸Your understanding will then inevitably value wrongly, and by endowing all thoughts with equal power will inevitably destroy peace. 
⁹That is why the Bible speaks of <q>the peace of God which passes understanding</q>. 
¹⁰This peace is totally incapable of being shaken by errors of any kind. 
¹¹It denies the ability of anything not of God to affect you. 
¹²This is the proper use of denial. 
¹³It is not used to hide anything, but to correct error. 
¹⁴It brings all error into the light, and since error and darkness are the same, it corrects error automatically.

<p>
2. True denial is a powerful protective device. 
²You can and should deny any belief that error can hurt you. 
³This kind of denial is not a concealment but a correction. 
⁴Your right mind depends on it. 
⁵Denial of error is a strong defence of truth, but denial of truth results in miscreation, the projections of the ego. 
⁶In the service of the right mind the denial of error frees the mind, and reëstablishes the freedom of the will. 
⁷When the will is really free it cannot miscreate, because it recognizes only truth.

<p>
3. You can defend truth as well as error. 
²The means are easier to understand after the value of the goal is firmly established. 
³It is a question of what it is <em>for</em>. 
⁴Everyone defends his treasure, and will do so automatically. 
⁵The real questions are, what do you treasure, and how much do you treasure it? 
⁶Once you have learned to consider these questions and to bring them into all your actions, you will have little difficulty in clarifying the means. 
⁷The means are available whenever you ask. 
⁸You can, however, save time if you do not protract this step unduly. 
⁹The correct focus will shorten it immeasurably.

<p>
4. The Atonement is the only defence that cannot be used destructively because it is not a device you made. 
²The Atonement <em>principle</em> was in effect long before the Atonement began. 
³The principle was love and the Atonement was an <em>act</em> of love. 
⁴Acts were not necessary before the separation, because belief in space and time did not exist. 
⁵It was only after the separation that the Atonement and the conditions necessary for its fulfillment were planned. 
⁶Then a defence so splendid was needed that it could not be misused, although it could be refused. 
⁷Refusal could not, however, turn it into a weapon of attack, which is the inherent characteristic of other defences. 
⁸The Atonement thus becomes the only defence that is not a two-edged sword. 
⁹It can only heal.

<p>
5. The Atonement was built into the space–time belief to set a limit on the need for the belief itself, and ultimately to make learning complete. 
²The Atonement is the final lesson. 
³Learning itself, like the classrooms in which it occurs, is temporary. 
⁴The ability to learn has no value when change is no longer necessary. 
⁵The eternally creative have nothing to learn. 
⁶You can learn to improve your perceptions, and can become a better and better learner. 
⁷This will bring you into closer and closer accord with the Sonship; but the Sonship itself is a perfect creation and perfection is not a matter of degree. 
⁸Only while there is a belief in differences is learning meaningful.

<p>
6. Evolution is a process in which you seem to proceed from one degree to the next. 
²You correct your previous missteps by stepping forward. 
³This process is actually incomprehensible in temporal terms, because you return as you go forward. 
⁴The Atonement is the device by which you can free yourself from the past as you go ahead. 
⁵It undoes your past errors, thus making it unnecessary for you to keep retracing your steps without advancing to your return. 
⁶In this sense the Atonement saves time, but like the miracle it serves, does not abolish it. 
⁷As long as there is need for Atonement, there is need for time. 
⁸But the Atonement as a completed plan has a unique relationship to time. 
⁹Until the Atonement is complete, its various phases will proceed in time, but the whole Atonement stands at time’s end. 
¹⁰At that point the bridge of return has been built.

<p>
7. The Atonement is a total commitment. 
²You may still think this is associated with loss, a mistake all the separated Sons of God make in one way or another. 
³It is hard to believe a defence that cannot attack is the best defence. 
⁴This is what is meant by <q>the meek shall inherit the earth</q>. 
⁵They will literally take it over because of their strength. 
⁶A two-way defence is inherently weak precisely because it has two edges, and can be turned against you very unexpectedly. 
⁷This possibility cannot be controlled except by miracles. 
⁸The miracle turns the defence of Atonement to your real protection, and as you become more and more secure you assume your natural talent of protecting others, knowing yourself as both a brother and a Son.
