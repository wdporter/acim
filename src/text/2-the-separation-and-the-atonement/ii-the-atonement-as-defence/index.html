<p>1. You can do anything I ask. 
I have asked you to perform miracles, and have made it clear that miracles are natural, corrective, healing and universal. 
There is nothing they cannot do, but they cannot be performed in the spirit of doubt or fear. 
When you are afraid of anything, you are acknowledging its power to hurt you. 
Remember that where your heart is, there is your treasure also. 
You believe in what you value. 
If you are afraid, you are valuing wrongly. 
Your understanding will then inevitably value wrongly, and by endowing all thoughts with equal power will inevitably destroy peace. 
That is why the Bible speaks of <q>the peace of God which passes understanding</q>. 
This peace is totally incapable of being shaken by errors of any kind. 
It denies the ability of anything not of God to affect you. 
This is the proper use of denial. 
It is not used to hide anything, but to correct error. 
It brings all error into the light, and since error and darkness are the same, it corrects error automatically.

<p>
2. True denial is a powerful protective device. 
You can and should deny any belief that error can hurt you. 
This kind of denial is not a concealment but a correction. 
Your right mind depends on it. 
Denial of error is a strong defence of truth, but denial of truth results in miscreation, the projections of the ego. 
In the service of the right mind the denial of error frees the mind, and reëstablishes the freedom of the will. 
When the will is really free it cannot miscreate, because it recognises only truth.

<p>
3. You can defend truth as well as error. 
The means are easier to understand after the value of the goal is firmly established. 
It is a question of what it is <em>for</em>. 
Everyone defends his treasure, and will do so automatically. 
The real questions are, what do you treasure, and how much do you treasure it? 
Once you have learned to consider these questions and to bring them into all your actions, you will have little difficulty in clarifying the means. 
The means are available whenever you ask. 
You can, however, save time if you do not protract this step unduly. 
The correct focus will shorten it immeasurably.

<p>
4. The Atonement is the only defence that cannot be used destructively because it is not a device you made. 
The Atonement <em>principle</em> was in effect long before the Atonement began. 
The principle was love and the Atonement was an <em>act</em> of love. 
Acts were not necessary before the separation, because belief in space and time did not exist. 
It was only after the separation that the Atonement and the conditions necessary for its fulfillment were planned. 
Then a defence so splendid was needed that it could not be misused, although it could be refused. 
Refusal could not, however, turn it into a weapon of attack, which is the inherent characteristic of other defences. 
The Atonement thus becomes the only defence that is not a two-edged sword. 
It can only heal.

<p>
5. The Atonement was built into the space–time belief to set a limit on the need for the belief itself, and ultimately to make learning complete. 
The Atonement is the final lesson. 
Learning itself, like the classrooms in which it occurs, is temporary. 
The ability to learn has no value when change is no longer necessary. 
The eternally creative have nothing to learn. 
You can learn to improve your perceptions, and can become a better and better learner. 
This will bring you into closer and closer accord with the Sonship; but the Sonship itself is a perfect creation and perfection is not a matter of degree. 
Only while there is a belief in differences is learning meaningful.

<p>
6. Evolution is a process in which you seem to proceed from one degree to the next. 
You correct your previous missteps by stepping forward. 
This process is actually incomprehensible in temporal terms, because you return as you go forward. 
The Atonement is the device by which you can free yourself from the past as you go ahead. 
It undoes your past errors, thus making it unnecessary for you to keep retracing your steps without advancing to your return. 
In this sense the Atonement saves time, but like the miracle it serves, does not abolish it. 
As long as there is need for Atonement, there is need for time. 
But the Atonement as a completed plan has a unique relationship to time. 
Until the Atonement is complete, its various phases will proceed in time, but the whole Atonement stands at time’s end. 
At that point the bridge of return has been built.

<p>
7. The Atonement is a total commitment. 
You may still think this is associated with loss, a mistake all the separated Sons of God make in one way or another. 
It is hard to believe a defence that cannot attack is the best defence. 
This is what is meant by <q>the meek shall inherit the earth</q>. 
They will literally take it over because of their strength. 
A two-way defence is inherently weak precisely because it has two edges, and can be turned against you very unexpectedly. 
This possibility cannot be controlled except by miracles. 
The miracle turns the defence of Atonement to your real protection, and as you become more and more secure you assume your natural talent of protecting others, knowing yourself as both a brother and a Son.
