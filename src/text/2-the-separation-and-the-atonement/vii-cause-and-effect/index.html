<p>
1. You may still complain about fear, but you nevertheless persist in making yourself fearful. 
²I have already indicated that you cannot ask me to release you from fear. 
³I know it does not exist, but you do not. 
⁴If I intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a basic law of cause and effect; the most fundamental law there is. 
⁵I would hardly help you if I depreciated the power of your own thinking. 
⁶This would be in direct opposition to the purpose of this course. 
⁷It is much more helpful to remind you that you do not guard your thoughts carefully enough. 
⁸You may feel that at this point it would take a miracle to enable you to do this, which is perfectly true. 
⁹You are not used to miracle-minded thinking, but you can be trained to think that way. 
¹⁰All miracle workers need that kind of training.

<p>
2. I cannot let you leave your mind unguarded, or you will not be able to help me. 
²Miracle working entails a full realisation of the power of thought in order to avoid miscreation. 
³Otherwise a miracle will be necessary to set the mind itself straight, a circular process that would not foster the time collapse for which the miracle was intended. 
⁴The miracle worker must have genuine respect for true cause and effect as a necessary condition for the miracle to occur.

<p>
3. Both miracles and fear come from thoughts. 
²If you are not free to choose one, you would also not be free to choose the other. 
³By choosing the miracle you <em>have</em> rejected fear, if only temporarily. 
⁴You have been fearful of everyone and everything. 
⁵You are afraid of God, of me and of yourself. 
⁶You have misperceived or miscreated Us, and believe in what you have made. 
⁷You would not have done this if you were not afraid of your own thoughts. 
⁸The fearful <em>must</em> miscreate, because they misperceive creation. 
⁹When you miscreate you are in pain. 
¹⁰The cause and effect principle now becomes a real expediter, though only temporarily. 
¹¹Actually, <q>Cause</q> is a term properly belonging to God, and His <q>Effect</q> is His Son. 
¹²This entails a set of Cause and Effect relationships totally different from those you introduce into miscreation. 
¹³The fundamental conflict in this world, then, is between creation and miscreation. 
¹⁴All fear is implicit in the second, and all love in the first. 
¹⁵The conflict is therefore one between love and fear.

<p>
4. It has already been said that you believe you cannot control fear because you yourself made it, and your belief in it seems to render it out of your control. 
²Yet any attempt to resolve the error through attempting the mastery of fear is useless. 
³In fact, it asserts the power of fear by the very assumption that it need be mastered. 
⁴The true resolution rests entirely on mastery through love. 
⁵In the interim, however, the sense of conflict is inevitable, since you have placed yourself in a position where you believe in the power of what does not exist.

<p>
5. Nothing and everything cannot coëxist. 
²To believe in one is to deny the other. 
³Fear is really nothing and love is everything. 
⁴Whenever light enters darkness, the darkness is abolished. 
⁵What you believe is true for you. 
⁶In this sense the separation <em>has</em> occurred, and to deny it is merely to use denial inappropriately. 
⁷However, to concentrate on error is only a further error. 
⁸The initial corrective procedure is to recognize temporarily that there is a problem, but only as an indication that immediate correction is needed. 
⁹This establishes a state of mind in which the Atonement can be accepted without delay. 
¹⁰It should be emphasised, however, that ultimately no compromise is possible between everything and nothing. 
¹¹Time is essentially a device by which all compromise in this respect can be given up. 
¹²It only seems to be abolished by degrees, because time itself involves intervals that do not exist. 
¹³Miscreation made this necessary as a corrective device. 
¹⁴The statement <q>For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoëver believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life</q> needs only one slight correction to be meaningful in this context: <q>He gave it <em>to</em> His only begotten Son</q>.

<p>
6. It should especially be noted that God has only <em>one</em> Son. 
²If all His creations are His Sons, every one must be an integral part of the whole Sonship. 
³The Sonship in its Oneness transcends the sum of its parts. 
⁴However, this is obscured as long as any of its parts is missing. 
⁵That is why the conflict cannot ultimately be resolved until all the parts of the Sonship have returned. 
⁶Only then can the meaning of wholeness in the true sense be understood. 
⁷Any part of the Sonship can believe in error or incompleteness if he so chooses. 
⁸However, if he does so, he is believing in the existence of nothingness. 
⁹The correction of this error is the Atonement.

<p>
7. I have already briefly spoken about readiness, but some additional points might be helpful here. 
²Readiness is only the prerequisite for accomplishment. 
³The two should not be confused. 
⁴As soon as a state of readiness occurs, there is usually some degree of desire to accomplish, but it is by no means necessarily undivided. 
⁵The state does not imply more than a potential for a change of mind. 
⁶Confidence cannot develop fully until mastery has been accomplished. 
⁷We have already attempted to correct the fundamental error that fear can be mastered, and have emphasised that the only real mastery is through love. 
⁸Readiness is only the beginning of confidence. 
⁹You may think this implies that an enormous amount of time is necessary between readiness and mastery, but let me remind you that time and space are under my control.
