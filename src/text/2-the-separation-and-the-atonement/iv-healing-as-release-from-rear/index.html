<p>
1. Our emphasis is now on healing. 
²The miracle is the means, the Atonement is the principle, and healing is the result. 
³To speak of <q>a miracle of healing</q> is to combine two orders of reality inappropriately. 
⁴Healing is not a miracle. 
⁵The Atonement, or the final miracle, is a remedy and any type of healing is a result. 
⁶The kind of error to which Atonement is applied is irrelevant. 
⁷All healing is essentially the release from fear. 
⁸To undertake this you cannot be fearful yourself. 
⁹You do not understand healing because of your own fear.

<p>
2. A major step in the Atonement plan is to undo error at all levels. 
²Sickness or ‘not-right-mindedness’ is the result of level confusion, because it always entails the belief that what is amiss on one level can adversely affect another. 
³We have referred to miracles as the means of correcting level confusion, for all mistakes must be corrected at the level on which they occur. 
⁴Only the mind is capable of error. 
⁵The body can act wrongly only when it is responding to misthought. 
⁶The body cannot create, and the belief that it can, a fundamental error, produces all physical symptoms. 
⁷Physical illness represents a belief in magic. 
⁸The whole distortion that made magic rests on the belief that there is a creative ability in matter which the mind cannot control. 
⁹This error can take two forms: it can be believed that the mind can miscreate in the body, or that the body can miscreate in the mind. 
¹⁰When it is understood that the mind, the only level of creation, cannot create beyond itself, neither type of confusion need occur.

<p>
3. Only the mind can create because spirit has already been created, and the body is a learning device for the mind. 
²Learning devices are not lessons in themselves. 
³Their purpose is merely to facilitate learning. 
⁴The worst a faulty use of a learning device can do is to fail to facilitate learning. 
⁵It has no power in itself to introduce actual learning errors. 
⁶The body, if properly understood, shares the invulnerability of the Atonement to two-edged application. 
⁷This is not because the body is a miracle, but because it is not inherently open to misinterpretation. 
⁸The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world. 
⁹Its abilities can be and frequently are overevaluated. 
¹⁰However, it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world. 
¹¹Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial. 
¹²The term ‘unworthy’ here implies only that it is not necessary to protect the mind by denying the unmindful. 
¹³If one denies this unfortunate aspect of the mind’s power, one is also denying the power itself.

<p>
4. All material means that you accept as remedies for bodily ills are restatements of magic principles. 
²This is the first step in believing that the body makes its own illness. 
³It is a second misstep to attempt to heal it through non-creative agents. 
⁴It does not follow, however, that the use of such agents for corrective purposes is evil. 
⁵Sometimes the illness has a sufficiently strong hold over the mind to render a person temporarily inaccessible to the Atonement. 
⁶In this case it may be wise to utilise a compromise approach to mind and body, in which something from the outside is temporarily given healing belief. 
⁷This is because the last thing that can help the non-right-minded, or the sick, is an increase in fear. 
⁸They are already in a fear-weakened state. 
⁹If they are prematurely exposed to a miracle, they may be precipitated into panic. 
¹⁰This is likely to occur when upside-down perception has induced the belief that miracles are frightening.

<p>
5. The value of the Atonement does not lie in the manner in which it is expressed. 
²In fact, if it is used truly, it will inevitably be expressed in whatever way is most helpful to the receiver. 
³This means that a miracle, to attain its full efficacy, must be expressed in a language that the recipient can understand without fear. 
⁴This does not necessarily mean that this is the highest level of communication of which he is capable. 
⁵It does mean, however, that it is the highest level of communication of which he is capable <em>now</em>. 
⁶The whole aim of the miracle is to raise the level of communication, not to lower it by increasing fear.
