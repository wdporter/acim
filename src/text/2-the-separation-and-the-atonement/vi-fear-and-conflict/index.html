<p>1. Being afraid seems to be involuntary; something beyond your own control. 
²Yet I have said already that only constructive acts should be involuntary. 
³My control can take over everything that does not matter, while my guidance can direct everything that does, if you so choose. 
⁴Fear cannot be controlled by me, but it can be self-controlled. 
⁵Fear prevents me from giving you my control. 
⁶The presence of fear shows that you have raised body thoughts to the level of the mind. 
⁷This removes them from my control, and makes you feel personally responsible for them. 
⁸This is an obvious confusion of levels.

<p>
2. I do not foster level confusion, but you must choose to correct it. 
²You would not excuse insane behaviour on your part by saying you could not help it. 
³Why should you condone insane thinking? 
⁴There is a confusion here that you would do well to look at clearly. 
⁵You may believe that you are responsible for what you do, but not for what you think. 
⁶The truth is that you are responsible for what you think, because it is only at this level that you can exercise choice. 
⁷What you do comes from what you think. 
⁸You cannot separate yourself from the truth by ‘giving’ autonomy to behaviour. 
⁹This is controlled by me automatically as soon as you place what you think under my guidance. 
¹⁰Whenever you are afraid, it is a sure sign that you have allowed your mind to miscreate and have not allowed me to guide it.

<p>
3. It is pointless to believe that controlling the outcome of misthought can result in healing. 
²When you are fearful, you have chosen wrongly. 
³That is why you feel responsible for it. 
⁴You must change your mind, not your behaviour, and this <em>is</em> a matter of willingness. 
⁵You do not need guidance except at the mind level. 
⁶Correction belongs only at the level where change is possible. 
⁷Change does not mean anything at the symptom level, where it cannot work.

<p>
4. The correction of fear <em>is</em> your responsibility. 
²When you ask for release from fear, you are implying that it is not. 
³You should ask, instead, for help in the conditions that have brought the fear about. 
⁴These conditions always entail a willingness to be separate. 
⁵At that level you <em>can</em> help it. 
⁶You are much too tolerant of mind wandering, and are passively condoning your mind’s miscreations. 
⁷The particular result does not matter, but the fundamental error does. 
⁸The correction is always the same. 
⁹Before you choose to do anything, ask me if your choice is in accord with mine. 
¹⁰If you are sure that it is, there will be no fear.

<p>
5. Fear is always a sign of strain, arising whenever what you want conflicts with what you do. 
²This situation arises in two ways: First, you can choose to do conflicting things, either simultaneously or successively. 
³This produces conflicted behaviour, which is intolerable to you because the part of the mind that wants to do something else is outraged. 
⁴Second, you can behave as you think you should, but without entirely wanting to do so. 
⁵This produces consistent behaviour, but entails great strain. 
⁶In both cases, the mind and the behaviour are out of accord, resulting in a situation in which you are doing what you do not wholly want to do. 
⁷This arouses a sense of coërcion that usually produces rage, and projection is likely to follow. 
⁸Whenever there is fear, it is because you have not made up your mind. 
⁹Your mind is therefore split, and your behaviour inevitably becomes erratic. 
¹⁰Correcting at the behavioural level can shift the error from the first to the second type, but will not obliterate the fear.

<p>
6. It is possible to reach a state in which you bring your mind under my guidance without conscious effort, but this implies a willingness that you have not developed as yet. 
²The Holy Spirit cannot ask more than you are willing to do. 
³The strength to do comes from your undivided decision. 
⁴There is no strain in doing God’s Will as soon as you recognise that it is also your own. 
⁵The lesson here is quite simple, but particularly apt to be overlooked. 
⁶I will therefore repeat it, urging you to listen. 
⁷Only your mind can produce fear. 
⁸It does so whenever it is conflicted in what it wants, producing inevitable strain because wanting and doing are discordant. 
⁹This can be corrected only by accepting a unified goal.

<p>
7. The first corrective step in undoing the error is to know first that the conflict is an expression of fear. 
²Say to yourself that you must somehow have chosen not to love, or the fear could not have arisen. 
³Then the whole process of correction becomes nothing more than a series of pragmatic steps in the larger process of accepting the Atonement as the remedy. 
⁴These steps may be summarised in this way:<br> 
 ⁵Know first that this is fear.<br> 
 ⁶Fear arises from lack of love.<br> 
 ⁷The only remedy for lack of love is perfect love.<br> 
 ⁸Perfect love is the Atonement.

<p>
8. I have emphasised that the miracle, or the expression of Atonement, is always a sign of respect <em>from</em> the worthy <em>to</em> the worthy. 
²The recognition of this worth is reëstablished by the Atonement. 
³It is obvious, then, that when you are afraid, you have placed yourself in a position where you need Atonement. 
⁴You have done something loveless, having chosen without love. 
⁵This is precisely the situation for which the Atonement was offered. 
⁶The need for the remedy inspired its establishment. 
⁷As long as you recognise only the need for the remedy, you will remain fearful. 
⁸However, as soon as you accept the remedy, you have abolished the fear. 
⁹This is how true healing occurs.

<p>
9. Everyone experiences fear. 
²Yet it would take very little right thinking to realise why fear occurs. 
³Few appreciate the real power of the mind, and no one remains fully aware of it all the time. 
⁴However, if you hope to spare yourself from fear there are some things you must realise, and realise fully. 
⁵The mind is very powerful, and never loses its creative force. 
⁶It never sleeps. 
⁷Every instant it is creating. 
⁸It is hard to recognise that thought and belief combine into a power surge that can literally move mountains. 
⁹It appears at first glance that to believe such power about yourself is arrogant, but that is not the real reason you do not believe it. 
¹⁰You prefer to believe that your thoughts cannot exert real influence because you are actually afraid of them. 
¹¹This may allay awareness of the guilt, but at the cost of perceiving the mind as impotent. 
¹²If you believe that what you think is ineffectual you may cease to be afraid of it, but you are hardly likely to respect it. 
¹³There <em>are</em> no idle thoughts. 
¹⁴All thinking produces form at some level.
