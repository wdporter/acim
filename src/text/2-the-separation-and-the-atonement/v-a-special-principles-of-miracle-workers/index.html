<h3>A. Special Principles of Miracle Workers</h3>

<p>
	11. (1) The miracle abolishes the need for lower-order concerns.
	²Since it is an out-of-pattern time interval, the ordinary considerations of time and space do not apply.
	³When you perform a miracle, I will arrange both time and space to adjust to it.

<p>
	12. (2) A clear distinction between what is created and what is made is essential.
	²All forms of healing rest on this fundamental correction in level perception.

<p>
	13. (3) Never confuse right- and wrong-mindedness.
	²Responding to any form of error with anything except a desire to heal is an expression of this confusion.

<p>
	14. (4) The miracle is always a denial of this error and an affirmation of the truth.
	²Only right-mindedness can correct in a way that has any real effect.
	³Pragmatically, what has no real effect has no real existence.
	⁴Its effect, then, is emptiness.
	⁵Being without substantial content, it lends itself to projection.

<p>
	15. (5) The level-adjustment power of the miracle induces the right perception for healing.
	²Until this has occurred healing cannot be understood.
	³Forgiveness is an empty gesture unless it entails correction.
	⁴Without this it is essentially judgmental, rather than healing.

<p>
	16. (6) Miracle-minded forgiveness is correction.
	²It has no element of judgment at all.
	³The statement “Father forgive them for they know not what they do” in no way evaluates what they do.
	⁴It is an appeal to God to heal their minds.
	⁵There is no reference to the outcome of the error.
	⁶That does not matter.

<p>
	17. (7) The injunction “Be of one mind” is the statement for revelation-readiness.
	²My request “Do this in remembrance of me” is the appeal for cooperation from miracle workers.
	³The two statements are not in the same order of reality.
	⁴Only the latter involves an awareness of time, since to remember is to recall the past in the present.
	⁵Time is under my direction, but timelessness belongs to God.
	⁶In time we exist for and with each other.
	⁷In timelessness we coëxist with God.

<p>
	18. (8) You can do much on behalf of your own healing and that of others if, in a situation calling for help, you
	think of it this way:

<p class="italic indent">
	²I am here only to be truly helpful.<br>
	³I am here to represent Him Who sent me.<br>
	⁴I do not have to worry about what to say or what to do, because He Who sent me will direct me.<br>
	⁵I am content to be wherever He wishes, knowing He goes there with me.<br>
	⁶I will be healed as I let Him teach me to heal.
