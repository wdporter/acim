	1. Before miracle workers are ready to undertake their function in this world, it is essential that they fully understand the fear of release.
	²Otherwise they may unwittingly foster the belief that release is imprisonment, a belief that is already very prevalent.
	³This misperception arises in turn from the belief that harm can be limited to the body.
	⁴That is because of the underlying fear that the mind can hurt itself.
	⁵None of these errors is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind do not really exist.
	⁶This recognition is a far better protective device than any form of level confusion, because it introduces correction at the level of the error.
	⁷It is essential to remember that only the mind can create, and that correction belongs at the thought level.
	⁸To amplify an earlier statement, spirit is already perfect and therefore does not require correction.
	⁹The body does not exist except as a learning device for the mind.
	¹⁰This learning device is not subject to errors of its own, because it cannot create.
	¹¹It is obvious, then, that inducing the mind to give up its miscreations is the only application of creative ability that is truly meaningful.

²Like all aspects of the belief in space and time, it is temporary.
