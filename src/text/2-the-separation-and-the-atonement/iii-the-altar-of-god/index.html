<p>
1. The Atonement can only be accepted within you by releasing the inner light. 
Since the separation, defences have been used almost entirely to defend <em>against</em> the Atonement, and thus maintain the separation. 
This is generally seen as a need to protect the body. 
The many body fantasies in which minds engage arise from the distorted belief that the body can be used as a means for attaining ‘atonement’. 
Perceiving the body as a temple is only the first step in correcting this distortion, because it alters only part of it. 
It <em>does</em> recognise that Atonement in physical terms is impossible. 
The next step, however, is to realise that a temple is not a structure at all. 
Its true holiness lies at the inner altar around which the structure is built. 
The emphasis on beautiful structures is a sign of the fear of Atonement, and an unwillingness to reach the altar itself. 
The real beauty of the temple cannot be seen with the physical eye. 
Spiritual sight, on the other hand, cannot see the structure at all because it is perfect vision. 
It can, however, see the altar with perfect clarity.

<p>
2. For perfect effectiveness the Atonement belongs at the centre of the inner altar, where it undoes the separation and restores the wholeness of the mind. 
Before the separation the mind was invulnerable to fear, because fear did not exist. 
Both the separation and the fear are miscreations that must be undone for the restoration of the temple, and for the opening of the altar to receive the Atonement. 
This heals the separation by placing within you the one effective defence against all separation thoughts and making you perfectly invulnerable.

<p>
3. The acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time. 
This may appear to contradict free will because of the inevitability of the final decision, but this is not so. 
You can temporise and you are capable of enormous procrastination, but you cannot depart entirely from your Creator, Who set the limits on your ability to miscreate. 
An imprisoned will engenders a situation which, in the extreme, becomes altogether intolerable. 
Tolerance for pain may be high, but it is not without limit. 
Eventually everyone begins to recognise, however dimly, that there <em>must</em> be a better way. 
As this recognition becomes more firmly established, it becomes a turning point. 
This ultimately reäwakens spiritual vision, simultaneously weakening the investment in physical sight. 
The alternating investment in the two levels of perception is usually experienced as conflict, which can become very acute. 
But the outcome is as certain as God.

<p>
4. Spiritual vision literally cannot see error, and merely looks for Atonement. 
All solutions the physical eye seeks dissolve. 
Spiritual vision looks within and recognises immediately that the altar has been defiled and needs to be repaired and protected. 
Perfectly aware of the right defence it passes over all others, looking past error to truth. 
Because of the strength of its vision, it brings the mind into its service. 
This reëstablishes the power of the mind and makes it increasingly unable to tolerate delay, realising that it only adds unnecessary pain. 
As a result, the mind becomes increasingly sensitive to what it would once have regarded as very minor intrusions of discomfort.

<p>
5. The children of God are entitled to the perfect comfort that comes from perfect trust. 
Until they achieve this, they waste themselves and their true creative powers on useless attempts to make themselves more comfortable by inappropriate means. 
But the real means are already provided, and do not involve any effort at all on their part. 
The Atonement is the only gift that is worthy of being offered at the altar of God, because of the value of the altar itself. 
It was created perfect and is entirely worthy of receiving perfection. 
God and His creations are completely dependent on Each Other. 
He depends on them <em>because</em> He created them perfect. 
He gave them His peace so they could not be shaken and could not be deceived. 
Whenever you are afraid you <em>are</em> deceived, and your mind cannot serve the Holy Spirit. 
This starves you by denying you your daily bread. 
God is lonely without His Sons, and they are lonely without Him. 
They must learn to look upon the world as a means of healing the separation. 
The Atonement is the guarantee that they will ultimately succeed.
