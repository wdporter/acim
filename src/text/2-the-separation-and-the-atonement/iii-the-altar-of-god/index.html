<p>
1. The Atonement can only be accepted within you by releasing the inner light. 
²Since the separation, defenses have been used almost entirely to defend <em>against</em> the Atonement, and thus maintain the separation. 
³This is generally seen as a need to protect the body. 
⁴The many body fantasies in which minds engage arise from the distorted belief that the body can be used as a means for attaining <q>atonement</q>. 
⁵Perceiving the body as a temple is only the first step in correcting this distortion, because it alters only part of it. 
⁶It <em>does</em> recognize that Atonement in physical terms is impossible. 
⁷The next step, however, is to realize that a temple is not a structure at all. 
⁸Its true holiness lies at the inner altar around which the structure is built. 
⁹The emphasis on beautiful structures is a sign of the fear of Atonement, and an unwillingness to reach the altar itself. 
¹⁰The real beauty of the temple cannot be seen with the physical eye. 
¹¹Spiritual sight, on the other hand, cannot see the structure at all because it is perfect vision. 
¹²It can, however, see the altar with perfect clarity.

<p>
2. For perfect effectiveness the Atonement belongs at the center of the inner altar, where it undoes the separation and restores the wholeness of the mind. 
²Before the separation the mind was invulnerable to fear, because fear did not exist. 
³Both the separation and the fear are miscreations that must be undone for the restoration of the temple, and for the opening of the altar to receive the Atonement. 
⁴This heals the separation by placing within you the one effective defense against all separation thoughts and making you perfectly invulnerable.

<p>
3. The acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time. 
²This may appear to contradict free will because of the inevitability of the final decision, but this is not so. 
³You can temporise and you are capable of enormous procrastination, but you cannot depart entirely from your Creator, Who set the limits on your ability to miscreate. 
⁴An imprisoned will engenders a situation which, in the extreme, becomes altogether intolerable. 
⁵Tolerance for pain may be high, but it is not without limit. 
⁶Eventually everyone begins to recognize, however dimly, that there <em>must</em> be a better way. 
⁷As this recognition becomes more firmly established, it becomes a turning point. 
⁸This ultimately reawakens spiritual vision, simultaneously weakening the investment in physical sight. 
⁹The alternating investment in the two levels of perception is usually experienced as conflict, which can become very acute. 
¹⁰But the outcome is as certain as God.

<p>
4. Spiritual vision literally cannot see error, and merely looks for Atonement. 
²All solutions the physical eye seeks dissolve. 
³Spiritual vision looks within and recognizes immediately that the altar has been defiled and needs to be repaired and protected. 
⁴Perfectly aware of the right defense it passes over all others, looking past error to truth. 
⁵Because of the strength of its vision, it brings the mind into its service. 
⁶This reëstablishes the power of the mind and makes it increasingly unable to tolerate delay, realising that it only adds unnecessary pain. 
⁷As a result, the mind becomes increasingly sensitive to what it would once have regarded as very minor intrusions of discomfort.

<p>
5. The children of God are entitled to the perfect comfort that comes from perfect trust. 
²Until they achieve this, they waste themselves and their true creative powers on useless attempts to make themselves more comfortable by inappropriate means. 
³But the real means are already provided, and do not involve any effort at all on their part. 
⁴The Atonement is the only gift that is worthy of being offered at the altar of God, because of the value of the altar itself. 
⁵It was created perfect and is entirely worthy of receiving perfection. 
⁶God and His creations are completely dependent on Each Other. 
⁷He depends on them <em>because</em> He created them perfect. 
⁸He gave them His peace so they could not be shaken and could not be deceived. 
⁹Whenever you are afraid you <em>are</em> deceived, and your mind cannot serve the Holy Spirit. 
¹⁰This starves you by denying you your daily bread. 
¹¹God is lonely without His Sons, and they are lonely without Him. 
¹²They must learn to look upon the world as a means of healing the separation. 
¹³The Atonement is the guarantee that they will ultimately succeed.
