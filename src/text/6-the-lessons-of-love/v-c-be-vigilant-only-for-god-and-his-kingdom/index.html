<p>1. We said before that the Holy Spirit is evaluative, and must be. 
²He sorts out the true from the false in your mind, and teaches you to judge every thought you allow to enter it in the light of what God put there. 
³Whatever is in accord with this light He retains, to strengthen the Kingdom in you. 
⁴What is partly in accord with it He accepts and purifies. 
⁵But what is out of accord entirely He rejects by judging against. 
⁶This is how He keeps the Kingdom perfectly consistent and perfectly unified. 
⁷Remember, however, that what the Holy Spirit rejects the ego accepts. 
⁸This is because they are in fundamental disagreement about everything, being in fundamental disagreement about what you are. 
⁹The ego’s beliefs on this crucial issue vary, and that is why it promotes different moods. 
¹⁰The Holy Spirit never varies on this point, and so the one mood He engenders is joy. 
¹¹He protects it by rejecting everything that does not foster joy, and so He alone can keep you wholly joyous.

<p>2. The Holy Spirit does not teach you to judge others, because He does not want you to teach error and learn it yourself. 
²He would hardly be consistent if He allowed you to strengthen what you must learn to avoid. 
³In the mind of the thinker, then, He <em>is</em> judgemental, but only in order to unify the mind so it can perceive without judgement. 
⁴This enables the mind to teach without judgement, and therefore to learn to <em>be</em> without judgement. 
⁵The undoing is necessary only in your mind, so that you will not project, instead of extend. 
⁶God Himself has established what you can extend with perfect safety. 
⁷Therefore, the Holy Spirit’s third lesson is:

<blockquote>⁸<em></em>Be vigilant only for God and His Kingdom.</em></blockquote>

<p>3. This is a major step toward fundamental change. 
²Yet it still has an aspect of thought reversal, since it implies that there is something you must be vigilant <em>against</em>. 
³It has advanced far from the first lesson, which is merely the beginning of the thought reversal, and also from the second, which is essentially the identification of what is more desirable. 
⁴This step, which follows from the second as the second follows from the first, emphasises the dichotomy between the desirable and the undesirable. 
⁵It therefore makes the ultimate choice inevitable.

<p>4. While the first step seems to increase conflict and the second may still entail conflict to some extent, this step calls for consistent vigilance against it. 
²I have already told you that you can be as vigilant against the ego as for it. 
³This lesson teaches not only that you can be, but that you <em>must</em> be. 
⁴It does not concern itself with order of difficulty, but with clear-cut priority for vigilance. 
⁵This lesson is unequivocal in that it teaches there must be no exceptions, although it does not deny that the temptation to make exceptions will occur. 
⁶Here, then, your consistency is called on despite chaos. 
⁷Yet chaos and consistency cannot coëxist for long, since they are mutually exclusive. 
⁸As long as you must be vigilant against anything, however, you are not recognising this mutual exclusiveness, and still believe that you can choose either one. 
⁹By teaching <em>what</em> to choose, the Holy Spirit will ultimately teach you that you need not choose at all. 
¹⁰This will finally liberate your mind from choice, and direct it towards creation within the Kingdom.
