<p>1. All who believe in separation have a basic fear of retaliation and abandonment. 
²They believe in attack and rejection, so that is what they perceive and teach and learn. 
³These insane ideas are clearly the result of dissociation and projection. 
⁴What you teach you are, but it is quite apparent that you can teach wrongly, and can therefore teach yourself wrong. 
⁵Many thought I was attacking them, even though it was apparent I was not. 
⁶An insane learner learns strange lessons. 
⁷What you must recognise is that when you do not share a thought system, you are weakening it. 
⁸Those who believe in it therefore perceive this as an attack on them. 
⁹This is because everyone identifies himself with his thought system, and every thought system centres on what you believe you are. 
¹⁰If the centre of the thought system is true, only truth extends from it. 
¹¹But if a lie is at its centre, only deception proceeds from it.

Beleif in separation leads to dissociation and projection. 
Dissociation and projection lead to attack and rejection. 
Attack and rejection lead to fear of retaliation and fear of abandonment. 
If you believe in the truth of what you are, you do not need to share this thought system.

<p>2. All good teachers realise that only fundamental change will last, but they do not begin at that level. 
²Strengthening motivation for change is their first and foremost goal. 
³It is also their last and final one. 
⁴Increasing motivation for change in the learner is all that a teacher need do to guarantee change. 
⁵Change in motivation is a change of mind, and this will inevitably produce fundamental change because the mind <i>is</i> fundamental.

<p>3. The first step in the reversal or undoing process is the undoing of the getting concept. 
²Accordingly, the Holy Spirit’s first lesson was “To have, give all to all”. 
³I said that this is apt to increase conflict temporarily, and we can clarify this still further now. 
⁴At this point, the equality of <i>having</i> and <i>being</i> is not yet perceived. 
⁵Until it is, <i>having</i> appears to be the opposite of <i>giving</i>. 
⁶Therefore, the first lesson seems to contain a contradiction, since it is being learned by a conflicted mind. 
⁷This means conflicting motivation, and so the lesson cannot be learned consistently as yet. 
⁸Further, the mind of the learner projects its own conflict, and thus does not perceive consistency in the minds of others, making him suspicious of their motivation. 
⁹This is the real reason why, in many respects, the first lesson is the hardest to learn. 
¹⁰Still strongly aware of the ego in yourself, and responding primarily to the ego in others, you are being taught to reäct to both as if what you do believe is not true.

²In fact, this is its only alternative since the other possibility, which would be much less acceptable to it, would obviously be that <i>it</i> is insane. 
³The ego’s judgement, here as always, is predetermined by what it is. 
⁴The fundamental change will still occur with the change of mind in the thinker. 
⁵Meanwhile, the increasing clarity of the Holy Spirit’s Voice makes it impossible for the learner not to listen. 
⁶For a time, then, he is receiving conflicting messages and accepting both.

²If you identify with your thought system, and you cannot escape this, and if you accept two thought systems which are in complete disagreement, peace of mind is impossible. 
³If you teach both, which you will surely do as long as you accept both, you are teaching conflict and learning it.
