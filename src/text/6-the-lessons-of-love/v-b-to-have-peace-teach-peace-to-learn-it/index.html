<p>
1. All who believe in separation have a basic fear of retaliation and abandonment. 
²They believe in attack and rejection, so that is what they perceive and teach and learn. 
³These insane ideas are clearly the result of dissociation and projection. 
⁴What you teach you are, but it is quite apparent that you can teach wrongly, and can therefore teach yourself wrong. 
⁵Many thought I was attacking them, even though it was apparent I was not. 
⁶An insane learner learns strange lessons. 
⁷What you must recognize is that when you do not share a thought system, you are weakening it. 
⁸Those who believe in it therefore perceive this as an attack on them. 
⁹This is because everyone identifies himself with his thought system, and every thought system centers on what you believe you are. 
¹⁰If the center of the thought system is true, only truth extends from it. 
¹¹But if a lie is at its center, only deception proceeds from it.

<p>
2. All good teachers realize that only fundamental change will last, but they do not begin at that level. 
²Strengthening motivation for change is their first and foremost goal. 
³It is also their last and final one. 
⁴Increasing motivation for change in the learner is all that a teacher need do to guarantee change. 
⁵Change in motivation is a change of mind, and this will inevitably produce fundamental change because the mind <em>is</em> fundamental.

<p>
3. The first step in the reversal or undoing process is the undoing of the getting concept. 
²Accordingly, the Holy Spirit’s first lesson was <q>To have, give all to all</q>. 
³I said that this is apt to increase conflict temporarily, and we can clarify this still further now. 
⁴At this point, the equality of <em>having</em> and <em>being</em> is not yet perceived. 
⁵Until it is, <em>having</em> appears to be the opposite of <em>giving</em>. 
⁶Therefore, the first lesson seems to contain a contradiction, since it is being learned by a conflicted mind. 
⁷This means conflicting motivation, and so the lesson cannot be learned consistently as yet. 
⁸Further, the mind of the learner projects its own conflict, and thus does not perceive consistency in the minds of others, making him suspicious of their motivation. 
⁹This is the real reason why, in many respects, the first lesson is the hardest to learn. 
¹⁰Still strongly aware of the ego in yourself, and responding primarily to the ego in others, you are being taught to react to both as if what you do believe is not true.

<p>
4. Upside down as always, the ego perceives the first lesson as insane. 
²In fact, this is its only alternative since the other possibility, which would be much less acceptable to it, would obviously be that <em>it</em> is insane. 
³The ego’s judgment, here as always, is predetermined by what it is. 
⁴The fundamental change will still occur with the change of mind in the thinker. 
⁵Meanwhile, the increasing clarity of the Holy Spirit’s Voice makes it impossible for the learner not to listen. 
⁶For a time, then, he is receiving conflicting messages and accepting both.

<p>
5. The way out of conflict between two opposing thought systems is clearly to choose one and relinquish the other. 
²If you identify with your thought system, and you cannot escape this, and if you accept two thought systems which are in complete disagreement, peace of mind is impossible. 
³If you teach both, which you will surely do as long as you accept both, you are teaching conflict and learning it. 
⁴Yet you do want peace, or you would not have called upon the Voice for peace to help you. 
⁵Its lesson is not insane; the conflict is.

<p>
6. There can be no conflict between sanity and insanity. 
²Only one is true, and therefore only one is real. 
³The ego tries to persuade you that it is up to you to decide which voice is true, but the Holy Spirit teaches you that truth was created by God, and your decision cannot change it. 
⁴As you begin to realize the quiet power of the Holy Spirit’s Voice, and Its perfect consistency, it must dawn on your mind that you are trying to undo a decision that was irrevocably made for you. 
⁵That is why I suggested before that you remind yourself to allow the Holy Spirit to decide for God for you.

<p>
7. You are not asked to make insane decisions, although you can think you are. 
²It must, however, be insane to believe that it is up to you to decide what God’s creations are. 
³The Holy Spirit perceives the conflict exactly as it is. 
⁴Therefore, His second lesson is:

<p class="italic indent">
⁵To have peace, teach peace to learn it.

<p>
8. This is still a preliminary step, since <em>having</em> and <em>being</em> are still not equated. 
²It is, however, more advanced than the first step, which is really only the beginning of the thought reversal. 
³The second step is a positive affirmation of what you want. 
⁴This, then, is a step in the direction out of conflict, since it means that alternatives have been considered, and one has been chosen as more desirable. 
⁵Nevertheless, the term <q>more desirable</q> still implies that the desirable has degrees. 
⁶Therefore, although this step is essential for the ultimate decision, it is clearly not the final one. 
⁷Lack of order of difficulty in miracles has not yet been accepted, because nothing is difficult that is <em>wholly</em> desired. 
⁸To desire wholly is to create, and creating cannot be difficult if God Himself created you as a creator.

<p>
9. The second step, then, is still perceptual, although it is a giant step toward the unified perception that reflects God’s knowing. 
²As you take this step and hold this direction, you will be pushing toward the center of your thought system, where the fundamental change will occur. 
³At the second step progress is intermittent, but the second step is easier than the first because it follows. 
⁴Realising that it <em>must</em> follow is a demonstration of a growing awareness that the Holy Spirit will lead you on.
