<p>
1. Like any good teacher, the Holy Spirit knows more than you do now, but He teaches only to make you equal with Him. 
²You had already taught yourself wrongly, having believed what was not true. 
³You did not believe in your own perfection. 
⁴Would God teach you that you had made a split mind, when He knows your mind only as whole? 
⁵What God does know is that His communication channels are not open to Him, so that He cannot impart His joy and know that His children are wholly joyous. 
⁶Giving His joy is an ongoing process, not in time but in eternity. 
⁷God’s extending outward, though not His completeness, is blocked when the Sonship does not communicate with Him as one. 
⁸So He thought, <q>My children sleep and must be awakened</q>.

<p>
2. How can you wake children in a more kindly way than by a gentle Voice that will not frighten them, but will merely remind them that the night is over and the light has come? 
²You do not inform them that the nightmares that frightened them so badly are not real, because children believe in magic. 
³You merely reassure them that they are safe <em>now</em>. 
⁴Then you train them to recognize the difference between sleeping and waking, so they will understand they need not be afraid of dreams. 
⁵And so when bad dreams come, they will themselves call on the light to dispel them.

<p>
3. A wise teacher teaches through approach, not avoidance. 
²He does not emphasize what you must avoid to escape from harm, but what you need to learn to have joy. 
³Consider the fear and confusion a child would experience if he were told, <q>Do not do this because it will hurt you and make you unsafe; but if you do that instead, you will escape from harm and be safe, and then you will not be afraid</q>. 
⁴It is surely better to use only three words: <q>Do only that!</q>. 
⁵This simple statement is perfectly clear, easily understood and very easily remembered.

<p>
4. The Holy Spirit never itemises errors because He does not frighten children, and those who lack wisdom <em>are</em> children. 
²Yet He always answers their call, and His dependability makes them more certain. 
³Children <em>do</em> confuse fantasy and reality, and they are frightened because they do not recognize the difference. 
⁴The Holy Spirit makes no distinction among dreams. 
⁵He merely shines them away. 
⁶His light is always the Call to awaken, whatever you have been dreaming. 
⁷Nothing lasting lies in dreams, and the Holy Spirit, shining with the light from God Himself, speaks only for what lasts forever.
