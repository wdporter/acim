<p>1. Remember that the Holy Spirit is the Answer, not the question. 
²The ego always speaks first. 
³It is capricious and does not mean its maker well. 
⁴It believes, and correctly, that its maker may withdraw his support from it at any moment. 
⁵If it meant you well it would be glad, as the Holy Spirit will be glad when He has brought you home and you no longer need His guidance. 
⁶The ego does not regard itself as part of you. 
⁷Herein lies its primary error, the foundation of its whole thought system.

The ego speaks first, <em>the Holy Spirit is the Answer</em>.
The ego is afraid of losing your support. 
The Holy Spirit is glad when you are brought home. 
The ego believes it is separate.

<p>2. When God created you He made you part of Him. 
²That is why attack within the Kingdom is impossible. 
³You made the ego without love, and so it does not love you. 
⁴You could not remain within the Kingdom without love, and since the Kingdom <em>is</em> love, you believe that you are without it. 
⁵This enables the ego to regard itself as separate and outside its maker, thus speaking for the part of your mind that believes <em>you</em> are separate and outside the Mind of God. 
⁶The ego, then, raised the first question that was ever asked, but one it can never answer. 
⁷That question, “What are you?” was the beginning of doubt. 
⁸The ego has never answered any questions since, although it has raised a great many. 
⁹The most inventive activities of the ego have never done more than obscure the question, because you have the answer and <em>the ego is afraid of you</em>.

<p>4. The ego cannot hear the Holy Spirit, but it does believe that part of the mind that made it is against it. 
²It interprets this as a justification for attacking its maker. 
³It believes that the best defence is attack, and wants <em>you</em> to believe it. 
⁴Unless you do believe it you will not side with it, and the ego feels badly in need of allies, though not of brothers. 
⁵Perceiving something alien to itself in your mind, the ego turns to the body as its ally, because the body is <em>not</em> part of you. 
⁶This makes the body the ego’s friend. 
⁷It is an alliance frankly based on separation.

<p>5. The ego uses the body to conspire against your mind, and because the ego realises that its ‘enemy’ can end them both merely by recognising they are not part of you, they join in the attack together. 
²This is perhaps the strangest perception of all, if you consider what it really involves. 
³The ego, which is not real, attempts to persuade the mind, which <em>is</em> real, that the mind is the ego’s learning device; and further, that the body is more real than the mind is. 
⁴No one in his right mind could possibly believe this, and no one in his right mind does believe it.
