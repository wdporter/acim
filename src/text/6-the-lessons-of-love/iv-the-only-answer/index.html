<p>1. Remember that the Holy Spirit is the Answer, not the question. 
The ego always speaks first. 
It is capricious and does not mean its maker well. 
It believes, and correctly, that its maker may withdraw his support from it at any moment. 
If it meant you well it would be glad, as the Holy Spirit will be glad when He has brought you home and you no longer need His guidance. 
The ego does not regard itself as part of you. 
Herein lies its primary error, the foundation of its whole thought system.

The ego speaks first, <i>the Holy Spirit is the Answer</i>.
The ego is afraid of losing your support. 
The Holy Spirit is glad when you are brought home. 
The ego believes it is separate.

<p>2. When God created you He made you part of Him. 
That is why attack within the Kingdom is impossible. 
You made the ego without love, and so it does not love you. 
You could not remain within the Kingdom without love, and since the Kingdom <i>is</i> love, you believe that you are without it. 
This enables the ego to regard itself as separate and outside its maker, thus speaking for the part of your mind that believes <i>you</i> are separate and outside the Mind of God. 
The ego, then, raised the first question that was ever asked, but one it can never answer. 
That question, “What are you?” was the beginning of doubt. 
The ego has never answered any questions since, although it has raised a great many. 
The most inventive activities of the ego have never done more than obscure the question, because you have the answer and <i>the ego is afraid of you</i>.

<p>3. You cannot understand the conflict until you fully understand the basic fact that the ego cannot know anything. 
The Holy Spirit does not speak first, <i>but He always answers</i>. 
Everyone has called upon Him for help at one time or another and in one way or another, and has been answered. 
Since the Holy Spirit answers truly He answers for all time, which means that everyone has the answer <i>now</i>.

<p>4. The ego cannot hear the Holy Spirit, but it does believe that part of the mind that made it is against it. 
It interprets this as a justification for attacking its maker. 
It believes that the best defence is attack, and wants <i>you</i> to believe it. 
Unless you do believe it you will not side with it, and the ego feels badly in need of allies, though not of brothers. 
Perceiving something alien to itself in your mind, the ego turns to the body as its ally, because the body is <i>not</i> part of you. 
This makes the body the ego’s friend. 
It is an alliance frankly based on separation. 
If you side with this alliance you will be afraid, because you are siding with an alliance of fear.

<p>5. The ego uses the body to conspire against your mind, and because the ego realises that its ‘enemy’ can end them both merely by recognising they are not part of you, they join in the attack together. 
This is perhaps the strangest perception of all, if you consider what it really involves. 
The ego, which is not real, attempts to persuade the mind, which <i>is</i> real, that the mind is the ego’s learning device; and further, that the body is more real than the mind is. 
No one in his right mind could possibly believe this, and no one in his right mind does believe it.

<p>6. Hear, then, the one answer of the Holy Spirit to all the questions the ego raises: You are a child of God, a priceless part of His Kingdom, which He created as part of Him. 
Nothing else exists and only this is real. 
You have chosen a sleep in which you have had bad dreams, but the sleep is not real and God calls you to awake. 
There will be nothing left of your dream when you hear Him, because you will awaken. 
Your dreams contain many of the ego’s symbols and they have confused you. 
Yet that was only because you were asleep and did not know. 
When you wake you will see the truth around you and in you, and you will no longer believe in dreams because they will have no reality for you. 
Yet the Kingdom and all that you have created there will have great reality for you, because they are beautiful and true.

You therefore retain the central place in your imagined enslavement, which in itself demonstrates that you are not enslaved.
