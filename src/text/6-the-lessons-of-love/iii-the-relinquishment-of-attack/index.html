<p>
1. As we have already emphasised, every idea begins in the mind of the thinker. 
²Therefore, what extends from the mind is still in it, and from <em>what</em> it extends it knows itself. 
³The word <q>knows</q> is correct here, because the Holy Spirit still holds knowledge safe in your mind through His impartial perception. 
⁴By attacking nothing, He presents no barrier to the communication of God. 
⁵Therefore, being is never threatened. 
⁶Your Godlike mind can never be defiled. 
⁷The ego never was and never will be part of it, but through the ego you can hear and teach and learn what is not true. 
⁸You have taught yourself to believe that you are not what you are. 
⁹You cannot teach what you have not learned, and what you teach you strengthen in yourself because you are sharing it. 
¹⁰Every lesson you teach you are learning.

<p>
2. That is why you must teach only one lesson. 
²If you are to be conflict-free yourself, you must learn only from the Holy Spirit and teach only by Him. 
³You are only love, but when you deny this, you make what you are something you must learn to remember. 
⁴I said before that the message of the crucifixion was, <q>Teach only love, for that is what you are</q>. 
⁵This is the one lesson that is perfectly unified, because it is the only lesson that is one. 
⁶Only by teaching it can you learn it. 
⁷<q>As you teach so will you learn</q>.
⁸If that is true, and it is true indeed, do not forget that what you teach is teaching you. 
⁹And what you project or extend you believe.

<p>
3. The only safety lies in extending the Holy Spirit, because as you see His gentleness in others your own mind perceives itself as totally harmless. 
²Once it can accept this fully, it sees no need to protect itself. 
³The protection of God then dawns upon it, assuring it that it is perfectly safe forever. 
⁴The perfectly safe are wholly benign. 
⁵They bless because they know that they are blessed. 
⁶Without anxiety the mind is wholly kind, and because it extends beneficence it is beneficent. 
⁷Safety is the complete relinquishment of attack. 
⁸No compromise is possible in this. 
⁹Teach attack in any form and you have learned it, and it will hurt you. 
¹⁰Yet this learning is not immortal, and you can unlearn it by not teaching it.

<p>
4. Since you cannot <em>not</em> teach, your salvation lies in teaching the exact opposite of everything the ego believes. 
²This is how you will learn the truth that will set you free, and will keep you free as others learn it of you. 
³The only way to have peace is to teach peace. 
⁴By teaching peace you must learn it yourself, because you cannot teach what you still dissociate. 
⁵Only thus can you win back the knowledge that you threw away. 
⁶An idea that you share you must have. 
⁷It awakens in your mind through the conviction of teaching it. 
⁸Everything you teach you are learning. 
⁹Teach only love, and learn that love is yours and you are love.
