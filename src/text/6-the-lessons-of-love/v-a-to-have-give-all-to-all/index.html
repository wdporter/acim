<p>1. When your body and your ego and your dreams are gone, you will know that you will last forever. 
²Perhaps you think this is accomplished through death, but nothing is accomplished through death, because death is nothing. 
³Everything is accomplished through life, and life is of the mind and in the mind. 
⁴The body neither lives nor dies, because it cannot contain you who are life. 
⁵If we share the same mind, you can overcome death because I did. 
⁶Death is an attempt to resolve conflict by not deciding at all. 
⁷Like any other impossible solution the ego attempts, <i>it will not work</i>.

<p>2. God did not make the body, because it is destructible, and therefore not of the Kingdom. 
²The body is the symbol of what you think you are. 
³It is clearly a separation device, and therefore does not exist. 
⁴The Holy Spirit, as always, takes what you have made and translates it into a learning device. 
⁵Again as always, He reïnterprets what the ego uses as an argument for separation into a demonstration against it. 
⁶If the mind can heal the body, but the body cannot heal the mind, then the mind must be stronger than the body. 
⁷Every miracle demonstrates this.

<p>3. I have said that the Holy Spirit is the motivation for miracles. 
²He always tells you that only the mind is real, because only the mind can be shared. 
³The body is separate, and therefore cannot be part of you. 
⁴To be of one mind is meaningful, but to be one body is meaningless. 
⁵By the laws of mind, then, the body is meaningless.

<p>4. To the Holy Spirit, there is no order of difficulty in miracles. 
²This is familiar enough to you by now, but it has not yet become believable. 
³Therefore, you do not understand it and cannot use it. 
⁴We have too much to accomplish on behalf of the Kingdom to let this crucial concept slip away. 
⁵It is a real foundation stone of the thought system I teach and want you to teach. 
⁶You cannot perform miracles without believing it, because it is a belief in perfect equality. 
⁷Only one equal gift can be offered to the equal Sons of God, and that is full appreciation. 
⁸Nothing more and nothing less. 
⁹Without a range, order of difficulty is meaningless, and there must be no range in what you offer to your brother.

<p>5. The Holy Spirit, Who leads to God, translates communication into being, just as He ultimately translates perception into knowledge. 
²You do not lose what you communicate. 
³The ego uses the body for attack, for pleasure and for pride. 
⁴The insanity of this perception makes it a fearful one indeed. 
⁵The Holy Spirit sees the body only as a means of communication, and because communicating is sharing it becomes communion. 
⁶Perhaps you think that fear as well as love can be communicated; and therefore can be shared. 
⁷Yet this is not so real as it may appear. 
⁸Those who communicate fear are promoting attack, and attack always breaks communication, making it impossible. 
⁹Egos do join together in temporary allegiance, but always for what each one can get <i>separately</i>. 
¹⁰The Holy Spirit communicates only what each one can give to all. 
¹¹He never takes anything back, because He wants you to keep it. 
¹²Therefore, His teaching begins with the lesson:

<blockquote><i>¹³To have, give all to all.</i></blockquote>

<p>6. This is a very preliminary step, and the only one you must take for yourself. 
²It is not even necessary that you complete the step yourself, but it is necessary that you turn in that direction. 
³Having chosen to go that way, you place yourself in charge of the journey, where you and only you must remain. 
⁴This step may appear to exacerbate conflict rather than resolve it, because it is the beginning step in reversing your perception and turning it right-side up. 
⁵This conflicts with the upside-down perception you have not yet abandoned, or the change in direction would not have been necessary. 
⁶Some remain at this step for a long time, experiencing very acute conflict. 
⁷At this point they may try to accept the conflict, rather than take the next step towards its resolution. 
⁸Having taken the first step, however, they will be helped. 
⁹Once they have chosen what they cannot complete alone, they are no longer alone.
