<p>1. Any split in mind must involve a rejection of part of it, and this <em>is</em> the belief in separation. 
The Wholeness of God, which is His peace, cannot be appreciated except by a whole mind that recognises the Wholeness of God’s creation. 
By this recognition it knows its Creator. 
Exclusion and separation are synonymous, as are separation and dissociation. 
We have said before that the separation was and is dissociation, and that once it occurs projection becomes its main defence, or the device that keeps it going. 
The reason, however, may not be so obvious as you think.

Separation is rejecting (or excluding) part of the mind. 
A mind must be whole to know God’s peace. 
Projection is used to keep separation going.

<p>2. What you project you disown, and therefore do not believe is yours. 
You are excluding yourself by the very judgement that you are different from the one on whom you project. 
Since you have also judged against what you project, you continue to attack it because you continue to keep it separated. 
By doing this unconsciously, you try to keep the fact that you attacked yourself out of awareness, and thus imagine that you have made yourself safe.

When you judge someone as separate (or different), you are making yourself separate. 
You then attack them by projecting your own separated state.

<p>3. Yet projection will always hurt you. 
It reïnforces your belief in your own split mind, and its only purpose is to keep the separation going. 
It is solely a device of the ego to make you feel different from your brothers and separated from them. 
The ego justifies this on the grounds that it makes you seem “better” than they are, thus obscuring your equality with them still further. 
Projection and attack are inevitably related, because projection is always a means of justifying attack. 
Anger without projection is impossible. 
The ego uses projection only to destroy your perception of both yourself and your brothers. 
The process begins by excluding something that exists in you but which you do not want, and leads directly to excluding you from your brothers.

Every ability of the ego has a better use, because its abilities are directed by the mind, which has a better Voice. 
The Holy Spirit extends and the ego projects. 
As their goals are opposed, so is the result.

<p>5. The Holy Spirit begins by perceiving you as perfect. 
Knowing this perfection is shared He recognises it in others, thus strengthening it in both. 
Instead of anger this arouses love for both, because it establishes inclusion. 
Perceiving equality, the Holy Spirit perceives equal needs. 
This invites Atonement automatically, because Atonement is the one need in this world that is universal. 
To perceive yourself this way is the only way in which you can find happiness in the world. 
That is because it is the acknowledgment that you are not in this world, for the world <em>is</em> unhappy.

You cannot be anywhere God did not put you, and God created you as part of Him. 
That is both where you are and what you are. 
It is completely unalterable. 
It is total inclusion. 
You cannot change it now or ever. 
It is forever true. 
It is not a belief, but a Fact. 
Anything that God created is as true as He is. 
Its truth lies only in its perfect inclusion in Him Who alone is perfect. 
To deny this is to deny yourself and Him, since it is impossible to accept one without the other.

The ego would prefer to believe that this memory is impossible, yet it is <em>your</em> perception the Holy Spirit guides. 
Your perception will end where it began. 
Everything meets in God, because everything was created by Him and in Him.

Yet the Holy Spirit tells you that even return is unnecessary, because what never happened cannot be difficult. 
However, you can <em>make</em> the idea of return both necessary and difficult. 
Yet it is surely clear that the perfect need nothing, and you cannot experience perfection as a difficult accomplishment, because that is what you are. 
This is the way in which you must perceive God’s creations, bringing all of your perceptions into the one line the Holy Spirit sees. 
This line is the direct line of communication with God, and lets your mind converge with His. 
There is no conflict anywhere in this perception, because it means that all perception is guided by the Holy Spirit, Whose Mind is fixed on God. 
Only the Holy Spirit can resolve conflict, because only the Holy Spirit is conflict-free. 
He perceives only what is true in your mind, and extends outward only to what is true in other minds.
