<p>1. Any split in mind must involve a rejection of part of it, and this <em>is</em> the belief in separation. 
²The Wholeness of God, which is His peace, cannot be appreciated except by a whole mind that recognises the Wholeness of God’s creation. 
³By this recognition it knows its Creator. 
⁴Exclusion and separation are synonymous, as are separation and dissociation. 
⁵We have said before that the separation was and is dissociation, and that once it occurs projection becomes its main defence, or the device that keeps it going. 
⁶The reason, however, may not be so obvious as you think.

Separation is rejecting (or excluding) part of the mind. 
A mind must be whole to know God’s peace. 
Projection is used to keep separation going.

<p>2. What you project you disown, and therefore do not believe is yours. 
²You are excluding yourself by the very judgement that you are different from the one on whom you project. 
³Since you have also judged against what you project, you continue to attack it because you continue to keep it separated. 
⁴By doing this unconsciously, you try to keep the fact that you attacked yourself out of awareness, and thus imagine that you have made yourself safe.

You then attack them by projecting your own separated state.

<p>3. Yet projection will always hurt you. 
²It reïnforces your belief in your own split mind, and its only purpose is to keep the separation going. 
³It is solely a device of the ego to make you feel different from your brothers and separated from them. 
⁴The ego justifies this on the grounds that it makes you seem “better” than they are, thus obscuring your equality with them still further. 
⁵Projection and attack are inevitably related, because projection is always a means of justifying attack. 
⁶Anger without projection is impossible. 
⁷The ego uses projection only to destroy your perception of both yourself and your brothers. 
⁸The process begins by excluding something that exists in you but which you do not want, and leads directly to excluding you from your brothers.

²Knowing this perfection is shared He recognises it in others, thus strengthening it in both. 
³Instead of anger this arouses love for both, because it establishes inclusion.

⁵This invites Atonement automatically, because Atonement is the one need in this world that is universal. 
⁶To perceive yourself this way is the only way in which you can find happiness in the world. 
⁷That is because it is the acknowledgment that you are not in this world, for the world <em>is</em> unhappy.

³No darkness abides anywhere in the Kingdom, but your part is only to allow no darkness to abide in your own mind. 
⁴Alignment with light by not allowing darkness in your mind is unlimited, because alignment with light is in alignment with the light of the world. 
⁵Each of us is the light of the world, and by joining our minds in the light of the world we proclaim the Kingdom of God together and as one.
