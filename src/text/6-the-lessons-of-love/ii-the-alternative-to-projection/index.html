<p>
1. Any split in mind must involve a rejection of part of it, and this <em>is</em> the belief in separation. 
²The Wholeness of God, which is His peace, cannot be appreciated except by a whole mind that recognizes the Wholeness of God’s creation. 
³By this recognition it knows its Creator. 
⁴Exclusion and separation are synonymous, as are separation and dissociation. 
⁵We have said before that the separation was and is dissociation, and that once it occurs projection becomes its main defense, or the device that keeps it going. 
⁶The reason, however, may not be so obvious as you think.

<p>
2. What you project you disown, and therefore do not believe is yours. 
²You are excluding yourself by the very judgment that you are different from the one on whom you project. 
³Since you have also judged against what you project, you continue to attack it because you continue to keep it separated. 
⁴By doing this unconsciously, you try to keep the fact that you attacked yourself out of awareness, and thus imagine that you have made yourself safe.

<p>
3. Yet projection will always hurt you. 
²It reinforces your belief in your own split mind, and its only purpose is to keep the separation going. 
³It is solely a device of the ego to make you feel different from your brothers and separated from them. 
⁴The ego justifies this on the grounds that it makes you seem “better” than they are, thus obscuring your equality with them still further. 
⁵Projection and attack are inevitably related, because projection is always a means of justifying attack. 
⁶Anger without projection is impossible. 
⁷The ego uses projection only to destroy your perception of both yourself and your brothers. 
⁸The process begins by excluding something that exists in you but which you do not want, and leads directly to excluding you from your brothers.

<p>
4. We have learned, however, that there <em>is</em> an alternative to projection. 
²Every ability of the ego has a better use, because its abilities are directed by the mind, which has a better Voice. 
³The Holy Spirit extends and the ego projects. 
⁴As their goals are opposed, so is the result.

<p>
5. The Holy Spirit begins by perceiving you as perfect. 
²Knowing this perfection is shared He recognizes it in others, thus strengthening it in both. 
³Instead of anger this arouses love for both, because it establishes inclusion. 
⁴Perceiving equality, the Holy Spirit perceives equal needs. 
⁵This invites Atonement automatically, because Atonement is the one need in this world that is universal. 
⁶To perceive yourself this way is the only way in which you can find happiness in the world. 
⁷That is because it is the acknowledgment that you are not in this world, for the world <em>is</em> unhappy.

<p>
6. How else can you find joy in a joyless place except by realising that you are not there? 
²You cannot be anywhere God did not put you, and God created you as part of Him. 
³That is both where you are and what you are. 
⁴It is completely unalterable. 
⁵It is total inclusion. 
⁶You cannot change it now or ever. 
⁷It is forever true. 
⁸It is not a belief, but a Fact. 
⁹Anything that God created is as true as He is. 
¹⁰Its truth lies only in its perfect inclusion in Him Who alone is perfect. 
¹¹To deny this is to deny yourself and Him, since it is impossible to accept one without the other.

<p>
7. The perfect equality of the Holy Spirit’s perception is the reflection of the perfect equality of God’s knowing. 
²The ego’s perception has no counterpart in God, but the Holy Spirit remains the Bridge between perception and knowledge. 
³By enabling you to use perception in a way that reflects knowledge, you will ultimately remember it. 
⁴The ego would prefer to believe that this memory is impossible, yet it is <em>your</em> perception the Holy Spirit guides. 
⁵Your perception will end where it began. 
⁶Everything meets in God, because everything was created by Him and in Him.

<p>
8. God created His Sons by extending His Thought, and retaining the extensions of His Thought in His Mind. 
²All His Thoughts are thus perfectly united within themselves and with each other. 
³The Holy Spirit enables you to perceive this wholeness <em>now</em>. 
⁴God created you to create. 
⁵You cannot extend His Kingdom until you know of its wholeness.

<p>
9. Thoughts begin in the mind of the thinker, from which they reach outward. 
²This is as true of God’s Thinking as it is of yours. 
³Because your mind is split, you can perceive as well as think. 
⁴Yet perception cannot escape the basic laws of mind. 
⁵You perceive from your mind and project your perceptions outward. 
⁶Although perception of any kind is unreal, you made it and the Holy Spirit can therefore use it well. 
⁷He can inspire perception and lead it toward God. 
⁸This convergence seems to be far in the future only because your mind is not in perfect alignment with the idea, and therefore does not want it now.

<p>
10. The Holy Spirit uses time, but does not believe in it. 
²Coming from God He uses everything for good, but He does not believe in what is not true. 
³Since the Holy Spirit is in your mind, your mind can also believe only what is true. 
⁴The Holy Spirit can speak only for this, because He speaks for God. 
⁵He tells you to return your whole mind to God, because it has never left Him. 
⁶If it has never left Him, you need only perceive it as it is to be returned. 
⁷The full awareness of the Atonement, then, is the recognition that <em>the separation never occurred</em>. 
⁸The ego cannot prevail against this because it is an explicit statement that the ego never occurred.

<p>
11. The ego can accept the idea that return is necessary because it can so easily make the idea seem difficult. 
²Yet the Holy Spirit tells you that even return is unnecessary, because what never happened cannot be difficult. 
³However, you can <em>make</em> the idea of return both necessary and difficult. 
⁴Yet it is surely clear that the perfect need nothing, and you cannot experience perfection as a difficult accomplishment, because that is what you are. 
⁵This is the way in which you must perceive God’s creations, bringing all of your perceptions into the one line the Holy Spirit sees. 
⁶This line is the direct line of communication with God, and lets your mind converge with His. 
⁷There is no conflict anywhere in this perception, because it means that all perception is guided by the Holy Spirit, Whose Mind is fixed on God. 
⁸Only the Holy Spirit can resolve conflict, because only the Holy Spirit is conflict-free. 
⁹He perceives only what is true in your mind, and extends outward only to what is true in other minds.

<p>
12. The difference between the ego’s projection and the Holy Spirit’s extension is very simple. 
²The ego projects to exclude, and therefore to deceive. 
³The Holy Spirit extends by recognising Himself in every mind, and thus perceives them as one. 
⁴Nothing conflicts in this perception, because what the Holy Spirit perceives is all the same. 
⁵Wherever He looks He sees Himself, and because He is united He offers the whole Kingdom always. 
⁶This is the one message God gave to Him and for which He must speak, because that is what He is. 
⁷The peace of God lies in that message, and so the peace of God lies in you. 
⁸The great peace of the Kingdom shines in your mind forever, but it must shine outward to make you aware of it.

<p>
13. The Holy Spirit was given you with perfect impartiality, and only by recognising Him impartially can you recognize Him at all. 
²The ego is legion, but the Holy Spirit is One. 
³No darkness abides anywhere in the Kingdom, but your part is only to allow no darkness to abide in your own mind. 
⁴This alignment with light is unlimited, because it is in alignment with the light of the world. 
⁵Each of us is the light of the world, and by joining our minds in this light we proclaim the Kingdom of God together and as one.
