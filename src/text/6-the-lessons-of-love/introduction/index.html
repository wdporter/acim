1. The relationship of anger to attack is obvious, but the relationship of anger to fear is not always so apparent. 
²Anger always involves projection of separation, which must ultimately be accepted as one’s own responsibility, rather than being blamed on others. 
³Anger cannot occur unless you believe that you have been attacked, that your attack is justified in return, and that you are in no way responsible for it. 
⁴Given these three wholly irrational premises, the equally irrational conclusion that a brother is worthy of attack rather than of love must follow. 
⁵What can be expected from insane premises except an insane conclusion? 
⁶The way to undo an insane conclusion is to consider the sanity of the premises on which it rests. 
⁷You cannot <em>be</em> attacked, attack <em>has</em> no justification, and you <em>are</em> responsible for what you believe.

2. You have been asked to take me as your model for learning, since an extreme example is a particularly helpful learning device. 
²Everyone teaches, and teaches all the time. 
³This is a responsibility you inevitably assume the moment you accept any premise at all, and no one can organise his life without some thought system. 
⁴Once you have developed a thought system of any kind, you live by it and teach it. 
⁵Your capacity for allegiance to a thought system may be misplaced, but it is still a form of faith and can be redirected.
