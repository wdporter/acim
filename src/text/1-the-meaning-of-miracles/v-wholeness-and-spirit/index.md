1. The miracle is much like the body in that both are learning aids for facilitating a state in which they become unnecessary. 
²When spirit’s original state of direct communication is reached, neither the body nor the miracle serves any purpose. 
³While you believe you are in a body, however, you can choose between loveless and miraculous channels of expression. 
⁴You can make an empty shell, but you cannot express nothing at all. 
⁵You can wait, delay, paralyse yourself or reduce your creativity almost to nothing. 
⁶But you cannot abolish it. 
⁷You can destroy your medium of communication, but not your potential. 
⁸You did not create yourself.

2. The basic decision of the miracle-minded is not to wait on time any longer than is necessary. 
²Time can waste as well as be wasted. 
³The miracle worker, therefore, accepts the time-control factor gladly. 
⁴He recognises that every collapse of time brings everyone closer to the ultimate release from time, in which the Son and the Father are One. 
⁵Equality does not imply equality *now*. 
⁶When everyone recognises that he has everything, individual contributions to the Sonship will no longer be necessary.

3. When the Atonement has been completed, all talents will be shared by all the Sons of God. 
²God is not partial. 
³All His children have His total Love, and all His gifts are freely given to everyone alike. 
⁴“Except ye become as little children” means that unless you fully recognise your complete dependence on God, you cannot know the real power of the Son in his true relationship with the Father. 
⁵The specialness of God’s Sons does not stem from exclusion but from inclusion. 
⁶All my brothers are special. 
⁷If they believe they are deprived of anything, their perception becomes distorted. 
⁸When this occurs the whole family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its relationships.

All are children of God.

All share God’s gifts equally. 
All are special. 
Do not believe you are deprived of anything. 
Believing in deprivation distorts perceptions. 
Distorted perceptions create distorted relationships.

(4) Since guilt makes God into an ememy, recognising our dependency on Him, which we have denied, can only occur when our inherent guiltlessness as God’s children is accepted. At this point, we are able to identify with our invulnerability as spirit, the prerequisite for forgiveness. This quotation of Jesus does not refer to the so-called innocence of children. As we have seen, children are born into the world with the same fullly developed egos we experience as adults. The perceived “innocence” is nothing more than the projection of the innocence that we feel has been lost in the infancy of the ego’s exsitence, when the separation occurred. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 171.)

(6) Without guilt’s demand to see others as separate from us, we are free to affirm our inherent unity in the Sonship of God …  Jesus’ lack of ego enabled him to have no special relationships. In his perception, none of his brothers or sisters was special. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.184.)

(6) The we–they battlefield … hating and attacking the other group … Thus its [the Course’s] students often confuse form with content, and forget Jesus’ statement in the text that “All my brothers are special” (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.590.)

(6) The “special” person of the Course is Jesus or the Holy Spirit; that is, the internal presence of God’s love that, again, leads Jesus to state that all his “brothers are special”.  (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.593.)

(6) The true teacher of God … is not one with a *special* mission, nor a *special* gift to give others *special* messages of wisdom. Rather, it is to remind others of the choice they may make to separate filnally from the ego’s specialness and to join Jesus’ love. Thus Jesus in reïnforcing for his students the idea that no one is more special than any other. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 111.)

4. Ultimately, every member of the family of God must return. 
²The miracle calls him to return because it blesses and honours him, even though he may be absent in spirit. 
³“God is not mocked” is not a warning but a reässurance. 
⁴God *would* be mocked if any of His creations lacked holiness. 
⁵The creation is whole, and the mark of wholeness is holiness. 
⁶Miracles are affirmations of Sonship, which is a state of completion and abundance.

5. Whatever is true is eternal, and cannot change or be changed. 
²Spirit is therefore unalterable because it is already perfect, but the mind can elect what it chooses to serve. 
³The only limit put on its choice is that it cannot serve two masters. 
⁴If it elects to do so, the mind can become the medium by which spirit creates along the line of its own creation. 
⁵If it does not freely elect to do so, it retains its creative potential but places itself under tyrannous rather than Authoritative control. 
⁶As a result it imprisons, because such are the dictates of tyrants. 
⁷To change your mind means to place it at the disposal of *true* Authority.

6. The miracle is a sign that the mind has chosen to be led by me in Christ’s service. 
²The abundance of Christ is the natural result of choosing to follow Him. 
³All shallow roots must be uprooted, because they are not deep enough to sustain you. 
⁴The illusion that shallow roots can be deepened, and thus made to hold, is one of the distortions on which the reverse of the Golden Rule rests. 
⁵As these false underpinnings are given up, the equilibrium is temporarily experienced as unstable. 
⁶However, nothing is less stable than an upside-down orientation. 
⁷Nor can anything that holds it upside down be conducive to increased stability.
