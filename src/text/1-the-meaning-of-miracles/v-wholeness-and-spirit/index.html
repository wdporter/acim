<p>1. The miracle is much like the body in that both are learning aids for facilitating a state in which they become unnecessary. 
²When spirit’s original state of direct communication is reached, neither the body nor the miracle serves any purpose. 
³While you believe you are in a body, however, you can choose between loveless and miraculous channels of expression. 
⁴You can make an empty shell, but you cannot express nothing at all. 
⁵You can wait, delay, paralyse yourself or reduce your creativity almost to nothing. 
⁶But you cannot abolish it. 
⁷You can destroy your medium of communication, but not your potential. 
⁸You did not create yourself.

<p>
2. The basic decision of the miracle-minded is not to wait on time any longer than is necessary. 
²Time can waste as well as be wasted. 
³The miracle worker, therefore, accepts the time-control factor gladly. 
⁴He recognizes that every collapse of time brings everyone closer to the ultimate release from time, in which the Son and the Father are One. 
⁵Equality does not imply equality <em>now</em>. 
⁶When everyone recognizes that he has everything, individual contributions to the Sonship will no longer be necessary.

<p>
3. When the Atonement has been completed, all talents will be shared by all the Sons of God. 
²God is not partial. 
³All His children have His total Love, and all His gifts are freely given to everyone alike. 
⁴<q>Except ye become as little children</q> means that unless you fully recognize your complete dependence on God, you cannot know the real power of the Son in his true relationship with the Father. 
⁵The specialness of God’s Sons does not stem from exclusion but from inclusion. 
⁶All my brothers are special. 
⁷If they believe they are deprived of anything, their perception becomes distorted. 
⁸When this occurs the whole family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its relationships.

<p>
4. Ultimately, every member of the family of God must return. 
²The miracle calls him to return because it blesses and honors him, even though he may be absent in spirit. 
³<q>God is not mocked</q> is not a warning but a reassurance. 
⁴God <em>would</em> be mocked if any of His creations lacked holiness. 
⁵The creation is whole, and the mark of wholeness is holiness. 
⁶Miracles are affirmations of Sonship, which is a state of completion and abundance.

<p>
5. Whatever is true is eternal, and cannot change or be changed. 
²Spirit is therefore unalterable because it is already perfect, but the mind can elect what it chooses to serve. 
³The only limit put on its choice is that it cannot serve two masters. 
⁴If it elects to do so, the mind can become the medium by which spirit creates along the line of its own creation. 
⁵If it does not freely elect to do so, it retains its creative potential but places itself under tyrannous rather than Authoritative control. 
⁶As a result it imprisons, because such are the dictates of tyrants. 
⁷To change your mind means to place it at the disposal of <em>true</em> Authority.

<p>
6. The miracle is a sign that the mind has chosen to be led by me in Christ’s service. 
²The abundance of Christ is the natural result of choosing to follow Him. 
³All shallow roots must be uprooted, because they are not deep enough to sustain you. 
⁴The illusion that shallow roots can be deepened, and thus made to hold, is one of the distortions on which the reverse of the Golden Rule rests. 
⁵As these false underpinnings are given up, the equilibrium is temporarily experienced as unstable. 
⁶However, nothing is less stable than an upside-down orientation. 
⁷Nor can anything that holds it upside down be conducive to increased stability.
