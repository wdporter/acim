<p>
1. Your distorted perceptions produce a dense cover over miracle impulses, making it hard for them to reach your own awareness. 
²The confusion of miracle impulses with physical impulses is a major perceptual distortion. 
³Physical impulses are misdirected miracle impulses. 
⁴All real pleasure comes from doing God’s Will. 
⁵This is because <em>not</em> doing it is a denial of Self. 
⁶Denial of Self results in illusions, while correction of the error brings release from it. 
⁷Do not deceive yourself into believing that you can relate in peace to God or to your brothers with anything external.

<p>
2. Child of God, you were created to create the good, the beautiful and the holy. 
²Do not forget this. 
³The Love of God, for a little while, must still be expressed through one body to another, because vision is still so dim. 
⁴You can use your body best to help you enlarge your perception so you can achieve real vision, of which the physical eye is incapable. 
⁵Learning to do this is the body’s only true usefulness.

<p>
3. Fantasy is a distorted form of vision. 
²Fantasies of any kind are distortions, because they always involve twisting perception into unreality. 
³Actions that stem from distortions are literally the reactions of those who know not what they do. 
⁴Fantasy is an attempt to control reality according to false needs. 
⁵Twist reality in any way and you are perceiving destructively. 
⁶Fantasies are a means of making false associations and attempting to obtain pleasure from them. 
⁷But although you can perceive false associations, you can never make them real except to yourself. 
⁸You believe in what you make. 
⁹If you offer miracles, you will be equally strong in your belief in them. 
¹⁰The strength of your conviction will then sustain the belief of the miracle receiver. 
¹¹Fantasies become totally unnecessary as the wholly satisfying nature of reality becomes apparent to both giver and receiver. 
¹²Reality is <q>lost</q> through usurpation, which produces tyranny. 
¹³As long as a single <q>slave</q> remains to walk the earth, your release is not complete. 
¹⁴Complete restoration of the Sonship is the only goal of the miracle-minded.

<p>
4. This is a course in mind training. 
²All learning involves attention and study at some level. 
³Some of the later parts of the course rest too heavily on these earlier sections not to require their careful study. 
⁴You will also need them for preparation. 
⁵Without this, you may become much too fearful of what is to come to make constructive use of it. 
⁶However, as you study these earlier sections, you will begin to see some of the implications that will be amplified later on.

<p>
5. A solid foundation is necessary because of the confusion between fear and awe to which I have already referred, and which is often made. 
²I have said that awe is inappropriate in connection with the Sons of God, because you should not experience awe in the presence of your equals. 
³However, it was also emphasized that awe is proper in the Presence of your Creator. 
⁴I have been careful to clarify my role in the Atonement without either over- or understating it. 
⁵I am also trying to do the same with yours. 
⁶I have stressed that awe is not an appropriate reaction to me because of our inherent equality. 
⁷Some of the later steps in this course, however, involve a more direct approach to God Himself. 
⁸It would be unwise to start on these steps without careful preparation, or awe will be confused with fear, and the experience will be more traumatic than beatific. 
⁹Healing is of God in the end. 
¹⁰The means are being carefully explained to you. 
¹¹Revelation may occasionally reveal the end to you, but to reach it the means are needed.
