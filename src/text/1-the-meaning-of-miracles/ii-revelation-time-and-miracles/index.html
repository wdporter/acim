<p>
1. Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear. 
²It reflects the original form of communication between God and His creations, involving the extremely personal sense of creation sometimes sought in physical relationships. 
³Physical closeness cannot achieve it. 
⁴Miracles, however, are genuinely interpersonal, and result in true closeness to others. 
⁵Revelation unites you directly with God. 
⁶Miracles unite you directly with your brother. 
⁷Neither emanates from consciousness, but both are experienced there. 
⁸Consciousness is the state that induces action, though it does not inspire it. 
⁹You are free to believe what you choose, and what you do attests to what you believe.

<p>
2. Revelation is intensely personal and cannot be meaningfully translated. 
²That is why any attempt to describe it in words is impossible. 
³Revelation induces only experience. 
⁴Miracles, on the other hand, induce action. 
⁵They are more useful now because of their interpersonal nature. 
⁶In this phase of learning, working miracles is important because freedom from fear cannot be thrust upon you. 
⁷Revelation is literally unspeakable because it is an experience of unspeakable love.

<p>
3. Awe should be reserved for revelation, to which it is perfectly and correctly applicable. 
²It is not appropriate for miracles because a state of awe is worshipful, implying that one of a lesser order stands before his Creator. 
³You are a perfect creation, and should experience awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection. 
⁴The miracle is therefore a sign of love among equals. 
⁵Equals should not be in awe of one another because awe implies inequality. 
⁶It is therefore an inappropriate reäction to me. 
⁷An elder brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience, and obedience for his greater wisdom. 
⁸He is also entitled to love because he is a brother, and to devotion if he is devoted. 
⁹It is only my devotion that entitles me to yours. 
¹⁰There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. 
¹¹I have nothing that does not come from God. 
¹²The difference between us now is that I have nothing else. 
¹³This leaves me in a state which is only potential in you.

<p>
4. <q>No man comes unto the Father but by me</q> does not mean that I am in any way separate or different from you except in time, and time does not really exist. 
²The statement is more meaningful in terms of a vertical rather than a horizontal axis. 
³You stand below me and I stand below God. 
⁴In the process of ‘rising up’, I am higher because without me the distance between God and man would be too great for you to encompass. 
⁵I bridge the distance as an elder brother to you on the one hand, and as a Son of God on the other. 
⁶My devotion to my brothers has placed me in charge of the Sonship, which I render complete because I share it. 
⁷This may appear to contradict the statement <q>I and my Father are one</q>, but there are two parts to the statement in recognition that the Father is greater.

<p>
5. Revelations are indirectly inspired by me because I am close to the Holy Spirit, and alert to the revelation-readiness of my brothers. 
²I can thus bring down to them more than they can draw down to themselves. 
³The Holy Spirit mediates higher to lower communication, keeping the direct channel from God to you open for revelation. 
⁴Revelation is not reciprocal. 
⁵It proceeds from God to you, but not from you to God.

<p>
6. The miracle minimises the need for time. 
²In the longitudinal or horizontal plane the recognition of the equality of the members of the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time. 
³However, the miracle entails a sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception. 
⁴This introduces an interval from which the giver and receiver both emerge farther along in time than they would otherwise have been. 
⁵The miracle thus has the unique property of abolishing time to the extent that it renders the interval of time it spans unnecessary. 
⁶There is no relationship between the time a miracle takes and the time it covers. 
⁷The miracle substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands of years. 
⁸It does so by the underlying recognition of perfect equality of giver and receiver on which the miracle rests. 
⁹The miracle shortens time by collapsing it, thus eliminating certain intervals within it. 
¹⁰It does this, however, within the larger temporal sequence.
