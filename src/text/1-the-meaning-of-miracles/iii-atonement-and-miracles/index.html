1. I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. 
²When you offer a miracle to any of my brothers, you do it to <em>yourself</em> and me. 
³The reason you come before me is that I do not need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you fail temporarily. 
⁴My part in the Atonement is the cancelling out of all errors that you could not otherwise correct. 
⁵When you have been restored to the recognition of your original state, you naturally become part of the Atonement yourself. 
⁶As you share my unwillingness to accept error in yourself and others, you must join the great crusade to correct it: listen to my voice, learn to undo error and act to correct it. 
⁷The power to work miracles belongs to you. 
⁸I will provide the opportunities to do them, but you must be ready and willing. 
⁹Doing them will bring conviction in the ability, because conviction comes through accomplishment. 
¹⁰The ability is the potential, the achievement is its expression, and the Atonement, which is the natural profession of the children of God, is the purpose.

<p>
2. <q>Heaven and earth shall pass away</q> means that they will not continue to exist as separate states. 
²My word, which is the resurrection and the life, shall not pass away because life is eternal. 
³You are the work of God, and His work is wholly lovable and wholly loving. 
⁴This is how a man must think of himself in his heart, because this is what he is.

<p>
3. The forgiven are the means of the Atonement. 
²Being filled with spirit, they forgive in return. 
³Those who are released must join in releasing their brothers, for this is the plan of the Atonement. 
⁴Miracles are the way in which minds that serve the Holy Spirit unite with me for the salvation or release of all of God’s creations.

<p>
4. I am the only one who can perform miracles indiscriminately, because I am the Atonement. 
²You have a role in the Atonement which I will dictate to you. 
³Ask me which miracles you should perform. 
⁴This spares you needless effort, because you will be acting under direct communication. 
⁵The impersonal nature of the miracle is an essential ingredient, because it enables me to direct its application, and under my guidance miracles lead to the highly personal experience of revelation. 
⁶A guide does not control but he does direct, leaving it up to you to follow. 
⁷<q>Lead us not into temptation</q> means <q>Recognise your errors and choose to abandon them by following my guidance</q>.

<p>5. Error cannot really threaten truth, which can always withstand it. 
²Only the error is actually vulnerable. 
³You are free to establish your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is inevitable if you remember this:

<p class="italic indent">
⁴Spirit is in a state of grace forever.<br> 
⁵Your reality is only spirit.<br> 
⁶Therefore you are in a state of grace forever.

<p>
⁷Atonement undoes all errors in this respect, and thus uproots the source of fear. 
⁸Whenever you experience God’s reässurances as threat, it is always because you are defending misplaced or misdirected loyalty. 
⁹When you project this to others you imprison them, but only to the extent to which you reïnforce errors they have already made. 
¹⁰This makes them vulnerable to the distortions of others, since their own perception of themselves is distorted. 
¹¹The miracle worker can only bless them, and this undoes their distortions and frees them from prison.

<p>
6. You respond to what you perceive, and as you perceive so shall you behave. 
²The Golden Rule asks you to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 
³This means that the perception of both must be accurate. 
⁴The Golden Rule is the rule for appropriate behaviour. 
⁵You cannot behave appropriately unless you perceive correctly. 
⁶Since you and your neighbour are equal members of one family, as you perceive both so you will do to both. 
⁷You should look out from the perception of your own holiness to the holiness of others.

<p>
7. Miracles arise from a mind that is ready for them. 
²By being united this mind goes out to everyone, even without the awareness of the miracle worker himself. 
³The impersonal nature of miracles is because the Atonement itself is one, uniting all creations with their Creator. 
⁴As an expression of what you truly are, the miracle places the mind in a state of grace. 
⁵The mind then naturally welcomes the Host within and the stranger without. 
⁶When you bring in the stranger, he becomes your brother.

<p>
8. That the miracle may have effects on your brothers that you may not recognise is not your concern. 
²The miracle will always bless <em>you</em>. 
³Miracles you are not asked to perform have not lost their value. 
⁴They are still expressions of your own state of grace, but the action aspect of the miracle should be controlled by me because of my complete awareness of the whole plan. 
⁵The impersonal nature of miracle-mindedness ensures your grace, but only I am in a position to know where they can be bestowed.

<p>
9. Miracles are selective only in the sense that they are directed towards those who can use them for themselves. 
²Since this makes it inevitable that they will extend them to others, a strong chain of Atonement is welded. 
³However, this selectivity takes no account of the magnitude of the miracle itself, because the concept of size exists on a plane that is itself unreal. 
⁴Since the miracle aims at restoring the awareness of reality, it would not be useful if it were bound by laws that govern the error it aims to correct.
