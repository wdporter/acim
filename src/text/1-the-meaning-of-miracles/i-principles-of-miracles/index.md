(1) In the vision of Heaven, there can be no gradations of illusions or mistakes. Something either is or it is not. … Truth is true; all else is only a mistake which, when brought to truth, is gently corrected, not judged against and punished. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 186).  

(1) [It’s] a simple plan for salvation that has no exceptions, [miracles] are all the same because there is likewise no hierarchy in illusions (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p. 562)  

(1) The first principle of miracles … counteracts the ego’s first law of chaos “there is a hierarchy of illusions” ([T-23.II.2:3](/text/23-the-war-against-yourself/ii-the-laws-of-chaos#2)). (Wapnick, A.A.C., p. 58.)  

The very first principle of miracles that begins the text proper contains the whole thought system of the Course. In that sense the rest of the text is a commentary on this first principle which is the cornerstone of the teaching. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.15.)

… the world of separation [is] made real, along with the seemingly infinite range of problems to be solved. Hence, the first principle of miracles — there is no order of difficulty among them — seems impossible and beyond our attainment. It is the purpose of *A Course in Miracles* to teach us that it is not only possible, but perfectly natural (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.51.)

This statement reflects the very practical nature of the Course. It is not teaching us simply the intellectual concept that time is an illusion; it is teaching us to recognise that all of our problems are the same. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.51.)

…they must first *decide* to accept God’s word. Demanding an external sign as proof of God is really believing in magic, since we must instead choose the miracle that reflects our internal shift. … Thus Jesus taught elsewhere, “Why does this generation demand a sign? I tell you solemnly, no sign shall be given to this generation” (*Mark* 8:12). No sign will be given because it would not be the loving or helpful thing to do, reïnforcing, as it where, the belief in magic which ultimately reïnforces the belief in separation.

::: details Commentary
Jesus clearly delineates the mutually exclusive nature of the levels of the mind and the body, and cautions his students against confusing them. Such confusion… is what is responsible for sickness. And it is the miracle that heals by redirecting the Son’s attention to the proper level — the mind instead of the body — whereïn is found both the problem and the answer. Here are the relevant level-confusion passages (also principles [17](#17), [23](#23), [30](#30)) that highlights the dimension of the miracle or healing (the mind) and sickness (the body) (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.230–231)

…the miracle reflects the change of mind that enables us to let go of our guilt, the belief in our past sinfulness. This then frees the Holy Spirit to work through us in the sense that we are now allowing the extension of His Love to occur. In the words of [Lesson 194](/workbook/part-1/194-i-place-the-future-in-the-hands-of-god): “I place the future in the hands of God”. This is not possible as long as we hold on to the ego’s guilt. It *is* possible, of course, when we let go of the guilt, and that is what releases the future. The “beginnings and endings” that is referred to can be understood as the beginning and the ending of a relationship. The “beginning” would be the special relationship that the ego has made real, while the “ending” is the forgiveness of that relationship — making it holy. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 123.)

(2–4) …the course urges us to look at the world benevolently: since we believe we are here, the world can be seen as kind, offering us iteself as a classroom in which we learn the lessons that will lead us beyond the world entirely … These lines echo the spirit of Origen, for whom the world was also a classroom. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C. p. 575–6.)

The point here is that the ego made time as a way of trapping us, reïnforcing our belief that separation and guilt are real, and so our fear of punishment is justified. The Holy Spirit, though, uses time in His own way within the illusion, so that He teaches us something else. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 123–124.)

Time is used by the Holy Spirit as a ‘teaching device’ not because it is real, but because it is a means whereby we can learn. When we have learned our lessons time will disappear. As time was not made by God, it is not eternal, lasting only as long as the dream that gave rise to it is accorded reality. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 125.)
