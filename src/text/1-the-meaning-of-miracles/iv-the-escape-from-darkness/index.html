1. The escape from darkness involves two stages: First, the recognition that darkness cannot hide. 
²This step usually entails fear. 
³Second, the recognition that there is nothing you want to hide even if you could. 
⁴This step brings escape from fear. 
⁵When you have become willing to hide nothing, you will not only be willing to enter into communion but will also understand peace and joy.

<p>
2. Holiness can never be really hidden in darkness, but you can deceive yourself about it. 
²This deception makes you fearful because you realise in your heart it <em>is</em> a deception, and you exert enormous efforts to establish its reality. 
³The miracle sets reality where it belongs. 
⁴Reality belongs only to spirit, and the miracle acknowledges only truth. 
⁵It thus dispels illusions about yourself, and puts you in communion with yourself and God. 
⁶The miracle joins in the Atonement by placing the mind in the service of the Holy Spirit. 
⁷This establishes the proper function of the mind and corrects its errors, which are merely lacks of love. 
⁸Your mind can be possessed by illusions, but spirit is eternally free. 
⁹If a mind perceives without love, it perceives an empty shell and is unaware of the spirit within. 
¹⁰But the Atonement restores spirit to its proper place. 
¹¹The mind that serves spirit <em>is</em> invulnerable.

<p>
3. Darkness is lack of light as sin is lack of love. 
²It has no unique properties of its own. 
³It is an example of the ‘scarcity’ belief, from which only error can proceed. 
⁴Truth is always abundant. 
⁵Those who perceive and acknowledge that they have everything have no needs of any kind. 
⁶The purpose of the Atonement is to restore everything to you; or rather, to restore it to your awareness. 
⁷You were given everything when you were created, just as everyone was.

<p>
4. The emptiness engendered by fear must be replaced by forgiveness. 
²That is what the Bible means by “There is no death”, and why I could demonstrate that death does not exist. 
³I came to fulfill the law by reïnterpreting it. 
⁴The law itself, if properly understood, offers only protection. 
⁵It is those who have not yet changed their minds who brought the ‘hell-fire’ concept into it. 
⁶I assure you that I will witness for anyone who lets me, and to whatever extent he permits it. 
⁷Your witnessing demonstrates your belief, and thus strengthens it. 
⁸Those who witness for me are expressing, through their miracles, that they have abandoned the belief in deprivation in favour of the abundance they have learned belongs to them.
