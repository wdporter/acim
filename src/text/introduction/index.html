1. This is a course in miracles. 
²It is a required course. 
³Only the time you take it is voluntary. 
⁴Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. 
⁵It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. 
⁶The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. 
⁷It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence, which is your natural inheritance. 
⁸The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.

2. This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:
</p>

<p class="italic bold indent">
²Nothing real can be threatened.<br> 
³Nothing unreal exists.
</p>

⁴Herein lies the peace of God.

		The real is that which cannot change.
		Whatever does change has no existence of its own.
		The peace of God lies in understanding this.
