1. <em>This is a course in miracles. 
²It is a required course. 
³Only the time you take it is voluntary. 
⁴Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. 
⁵It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. 
⁶The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. 
⁷It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence, which is your natural inheritance. 
⁸The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.</em>

The real is that which can’t be threatened because it cannot change. 
Anything that can change doesn’t actually exist. 
True peace is knowing this.
