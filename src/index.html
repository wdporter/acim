<h2>Text</h2>

<p>
This is a course in miracles. 
It is a required course. 
Only the time you take it is voluntary. 
Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. 
It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. 
The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. 
It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love‚Äôs presence, which is your natural inheritance. 
The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite. <a href=/text/>[ü°ï]</a>

<h2>Workbook for Students</h2>

<p>
A theoretical foundation, such as the text, is necessary as a background to make these exercises meaningful. 
Yet it is the exercises that will make the goal possible. 
An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. 
It is the purpose of these exercises to train the mind to think along the lines which the course sets forth.

<h2>Manual for Teachers</h2>

<p>
The role of teaching and learning is actually reversed in the thinking of the world. 
The reversal is characteristic. 
It seems as if the teacher and the learner are separated, the teacher giving something to the learner rather than to himself. 
Further, the act of teaching is regarded as a special activity in which one engages only a relatively small proportion of one‚Äôs time. 
The course, on the other hand, emphasizes that to teach is to learn, so that teacher and learner are the same. 
It also emphasizes that teaching is a constant process; it goes on every moment of the day and continues into sleeping thoughts as well.

<h2>Clarification of Terms</h2>

<p>
This is not a course in philosophical speculation, nor is it concerned with precise terminology. 
It is concerned only with Atonement, or the correction of perception. 
The means of the Atonement is forgiveness. 
The structure of ‚Äúindividual consciousness‚Äù is essentially irrelevant because it is a concept representing the ‚Äúoriginal error‚Äù or the ‚Äúoriginal sin‚Äù.
To study the error itself does not lead to correction, if you are indeed to succeed in overlooking the error. 
And it is just this process of overlooking at which the course aims.
