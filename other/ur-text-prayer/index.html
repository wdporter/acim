<div class=content>
	<p>I would like to pray that my will be united with yours, recognising that your perfect love will suffice (or correct) for my imperfect love. 

	<p>I pray that I may accept the Atonement with conviction, recognising its inevitable worth, and my own divine worth as part of this identification with you. 

	<p>I pray that my fear be replaced by an active sense of your love, and your continual willingness to help me overcome the split, or divided will, which is responsible for my difficulty with this. 

	<p>I accept the divinity of the messages we have received, and affirm my will in both accepting and acting upon the Atonement principle.

	<p>Here I am.
