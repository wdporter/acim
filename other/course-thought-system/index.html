    <p>Humankind, all of us, was created whole and perfect by an infinite intelligence, an eternal being of Love and Light — God.
<p>This Perfect creation is the Christ.
<p>Love and Light are the energy and substance of God and the created Christ, us.
<p>God and the Christ are eternal, they are the all that exists.
<p>Everything else is an illusion.
</div>
<div>
<p>Into this reality, where all was one, a false idea came into the mind of the Christ,<br>
&emsp;the idea that the Christ could somehow exist without there being a Creator.
<p>This false idea is not a problem, the problem arose<br>
&emsp;when the creation took the idea seriously and forgot to laugh at it.
<p>That was the original “sin” or the original “mistake”.
<p>The force of this mistake was so seemingly powerful,<br>
&emsp;that the Christ Mind Literally “knocked itself out”. It put itself to sleep.
<p>The creation now became lost in the nightmare it was having while asleep.
<p>This nightmare, is the three-dimensional world of time and space<br>
&emsp;we appear to find ourselves in.
<p>Since this world is based on the thought that we could cut ourselves off<br>
&emsp;from light and life, in it are the dark illusions of sickness, death and war.
<p>This is a world of total illusion. Nothing in it is “real”.
</div>
<div>
<p>However, since we are all still connected to God,<br>
&emsp;there is still a Voice for God in our minds.
<p>This Voice is the Holy Spirit.
<p>There is another voice that tells us our illusions are true and<br>
&emsp;that we are separate, isolated entities. This other voice is the ego.
<p>The Holy Spirit is in a continual process of correcting our thinking.
<p>Holy Spirit has a correction for every ego thought of separation.
<p>This process of correcting the ego is called the Atonement.
<p>Once we learn, through the Holy Spirit’s help,<br>
&emsp;that we are dreaming the world we think we are in, we can change the dream.
<p>Through true forgiveness and non-judgment we correct, or atone for,<br>
&emsp;the separation idea we forgot to laugh at and our minds start to heal.
<p>The world we now see begins to reflect our healing minds.
<p>The dark illusions of sickness, death and war start to heal.
<p>The world becomes happier and healthier and more full of light.
<p>We call this healed existence the “real world” because it is closer to reality.
</div>
<div>
<p>Finally, when the mind is totally healed, our Creator, God, wakes us up and<br>
&emsp;this illusion of what never was simply ceases to be.
