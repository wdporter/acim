1. Possessive plurals have the apostrophe last. Possessive singulars ending in s end with 's. e.g. Jesus's advice. All the birds' nests.

2. Replace which and use a semi-colon.  e.g. "You shit on the carpet, which is bad" becomes "You shit on the carpet; shitting on the carpet is bad".

3. Multiple words in a possessive are joined with dashes. e.g.  "their [dogs that bite] teeth" becomes "dogs-that-bite's teeth".
