    <p>This is a <em>catena aurea</em> (golden chain) for <em>A Course in Miracles</em>. </p>
    <p>The course text is supplied in alternative renderings which substitute pronouns.<p>
    <p>I have provided my own summary for each paragraph.</p>   
    <p>I have also provided excerpts from well known course commentators</p>
    <p>I very much welcome correspondence with suggestions for improvements or additions.</p>
    <p>The site is built with static site generator Jekyll and the <a href=https://github.com/W-David-Porter/acim>sources are in github https://github.com/W-David-Porter/acim</a>. </p>
    <p>If you don't know what github is, you can <a href=mailto:davidporter65@outlook.com>email me</a> instead. </p>
    <p>Help with CSS and site design would be appreciated also.</p>
    <p>There is no social media until I learn to forgive social media.</p>
