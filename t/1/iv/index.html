<p>T-1.IV.1.&emsp;The escape from darkness involves two stages: First, the recognition that darkness cannot hide. <sup>2</sup> This step usually entails fear. <sup>3</sup> Second, the recognition that there is nothing you want to hide even if you could. <sup>4</sup> This step brings escape from fear. <sup>5</sup> When you have become willing to hide nothing, you will not only be willing to enter into communion but will also understand peace and joy.

<p>T-1.IV.2.&emsp;Holiness can never be really hidden in darkness, but you can deceive yourself about it. <sup>2</sup> This deception makes you fearful because you realize in your heart it is a deception, and you exert enormous efforts to establish its reality. <sup>3</sup> The miracle sets reality where it belongs. <sup>4</sup> Reality belongs only to spirit, and the miracle acknowledges only truth. <sup>5</sup> It thus dispels illusions about yourself, and puts you in communion with yourself and God. <sup>6</sup> The miracle joins in the Atonement by placing the mind in the service of the Holy Spirit. <sup>7</sup> This establishes the proper function of the mind and corrects its errors, which are merely lacks of love. <sup>8</sup> Your mind can be possessed by illusions, but spirit is eternally free. <sup>9</sup> If a mind perceives without love, it perceives an empty shell and is unaware of the spirit within. <sup>10</sup> But the Atonement restores spirit to its proper place. <sup>11</sup> The mind that serves spirit is invulnerable.

<p>T-1.IV.3.&emsp;Darkness is lack of light as sin is lack of love. <sup>2</sup> It has no unique properties of its own. <sup>3</sup> It is an example of the “scarcity” belief, from which only error can proceed. <sup>4</sup> Truth is always abundant. <sup>5</sup> Those who perceive and acknowledge that they have everything have no needs of any kind. <sup>6</sup> The purpose of the Atonement is to restore everything to you; or rather, to restore it to your awareness. <sup>7</sup> You were given everything when you were created, just as everyone was.

<p>T-1.IV.4.&emsp;The emptiness engendered by fear must be replaced by forgiveness. <sup>2</sup> That is what the Bible means by “There is no death,” and why I could demonstrate that death does not exist. <sup>3</sup> I came to fulfill the law by reinterpreting it. <sup>4</sup> The law itself, if properly understood, offers only protection. <sup>5</sup> It is those who have not yet changed their minds who brought the “hell-fire” concept into it. <sup>6</sup> I assure you that I will witness for anyone who lets me, and to whatever extent he permits it. <sup>7</sup> Your witnessing demonstrates your belief, and thus strengthens it. <sup>8</sup> Those who witness for me are expressing, through their miracles, that they have abandoned the belief in deprivation in favor of the abundance they have learned belongs to them.
