      4. All miracles mean life, and God is the Giver of life. 2His Voice will direct you very specifically. 3You will be told all you need to know.
      5. Miracles are habits, and should be involuntary. 2They should not be under conscious control. 3Consciously selected miracles can be misguided.
      6. Miracles are natural. 2When they do not occur something has gone wrong.
      7. Miracles are everyone’s right, but purification is necessary first.
      8. Miracles are healing because they supply a lack; they are performed by those who temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less.
      9. Miracles are a kind of exchange. 2Like all expressions of love, which are always miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. 3They bring more love both to the giver and the receiver.
      10. The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is a misunderstanding of their purpose.
      11. Prayer is the medium of miracles. 2It is a means of communication of the created with the Creator. 3Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love is expressed.
      12. Miracles are thoughts. 2Thoughts can represent the lower or bodily level of experience, or the higher or spiritual level of experience. 3One makes the physical, and the other creates the spiritual.
      13. Miracles are both beginnings and endings, and so they alter the temporal order. 2They are always affirmations of rebirth, which seem to go back but really go forward. 3They undo the past in the present, and thus release the future.
      14. Miracles bear witness to truth. 2They are convincing because they arise from conviction. 3Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive; or rather, the uncreative use of mind.
      15. Each day should be devoted to miracles. 2The purpose of time is to enable you to learn how to use time constructively. 3It is thus a teaching device and a means to an end. 4Time will cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating learning.
      16. Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating it is as blessed to give as to receive. 2They simultaneously increase the strength of the giver and supply strength to the receiver.
      17. Miracles transcend the body. 2They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from the bodily level. 3That is why they heal.
      18. A miracle is a service. 2It is the maximal service you can render to another. 3It is a way of loving your neighbour as yourself. 4You recognise your own and your neighbour’s worth simultaneously.
      19. Miracles make minds one in God. 2They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is the sum of all that God created. 3Miracles therefore reflect the laws of eternity, not of time.
      20. Miracles reawaken the awareness that the spirit, not the body, is the altar of truth. 2This is the recognition that leads to the healing power of the miracle.
      21. Miracles are natural signs of forgiveness. 2Through miracles you accept God’s forgiveness by extending it to others.
      22. Miracles are associated with fear only because of the belief that darkness can hide. 2You believe that what your physical eyes cannot see does not exist. 3This leads to a denial of spiritual sight.
      23. Miracles rearrange perception and place all levels in true perspective. 2This is healing because sickness comes from confusing the levels.
      24. Miracles enable you to heal the sick and raise the dead because you made sickness and death yourself, and can therefore abolish both. 2You are a miracle, capable of creating in the likeness of your Creator. 3Everything else is your own nightmare, and does not exist. 4Only the creations of light are real.
      25. Miracles are part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the Atonement. 2Atonement works all the time and in all the dimensions of time.
      26. Miracles represent freedom from fear. 2“Atoning” means “undoing”. 3The undoing of fear is an essential part of the Atonement value of miracles.
      27. A miracle is a universal blessing from God through me to all my brothers. 2It is the privilege of the forgiven to forgive.
      28. Miracles are a way of earning release from fear. 2Revelation induces a state in which fear has already been abolished. 3Miracles are thus a means and revelation is an end.
      29. Miracles praise God through you. 2They praise Him by honouring His creations, affirming their perfection. 3They heal because they deny body-identification and affirm spirit-identification.
      30. By recognising spirit, miracles adjust the levels of perception and show them in proper alignment. 2This places spirit at the centre, where it can communicate directly.
      31. Miracles should inspire gratitude, not awe. 2You should thank God for what you really are. 3The children of God are holy and the miracle honours their holiness, which can be hidden but never lost.
      32. I inspire all miracles, which are really intercessions. 2They intercede for your holiness and make your perceptions holy. 3By placing you beyond the physical laws they raise you into the sphere of celestial order. 4In this order you are perfect.
      33. Miracles honour you because you are loveable. 2They dispel illusions about yourself and perceive the light in you. 3They thus atone for your errors by freeing you from your nightmares. 4By releasing your mind from the imprisonment of your illusions, they restore your sanity.
      34. Miracles restore the mind to its fullness. 2By atoning for lack they establish perfect protection. 3The spirit’s strength leaves no room for intrusions.
      35. Miracles are expressions of love, but they may not always have observable effects.
      36. Miracles are examples of right thinking, aligning your perceptions with truth as God created it.
      37. A miracle is a correction introduced into false thinking by me. 2It acts as a catalyst, breaking up erroneous perception and reorganising it properly. 3This places you under the Atonement principle, where perception is healed. 4Until this has occurred, knowledge of the Divine Order is impossible.
      38. The Holy Spirit is the mechanism of miracles. 2He recognises both God’s creations and your illusions. 3He separates the true from the false by His ability to perceive totally rather than selectively.
      39. The miracle dissolves error because the Holy Spirit identifies error as false or unreal. 2This is the same as saying that by perceiving light, darkness automatically disappears.
      40. The miracle acknowledges everyone as your brother and mine. 2It is a way of perceiving the universal mark of God.
      41. Wholeness is the perceptual content of miracles. 2They thus correct, or atone for, the faulty perception of lack.
      42. A major contribution of miracles is their strength in releasing you from your false sense of isolation, deprivation and lack.
      43. Miracles arise from a miraculous state of mind, or a state of miracle-readiness.
      44. The miracle is an expression of an inner awareness of Christ and the acceptance of His Atonement.
      45. A miracle is never lost. 2It may touch many people you have not even met, and produce undreamed of changes in situations of which you are not even aware.
      46. The Holy Spirit is the highest communication medium. 2Miracles do not involve this type of communication, because they are temporary communication devices. 3When you return to your original form of communication with God by direct revelation, the need for miracles is over.
      47. The miracle is a learning device that lessens the need for time. 2It establishes an out-of-pattern time interval not under the usual laws of time. 3In this sense it is timeless.
      48. The miracle is the only device at your immediate disposal for controlling time. 2Only revelation transcends it, having nothing to do with time at all.
      49. The miracle makes no distinction among degrees of misperception. 2It is a device for perception correction, effective quite apart from either the degree or the direction of the error. 3This is its true indiscriminateness.
      50. The miracle compares what you have made with creation, accepting what is in accord with it as true, and rejecting what is out of accord as false.
