  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.30">
    <p class=native>30.&emsp;By recognising spirit, miracles adjust the levels of perception and show them in proper alignment. 2This places spirit at the centre, where it can communicate directly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.31">
    <p class=native>31.&emsp;Miracles should inspire gratitude, not awe. 2You should thank God for what you really are. 3The children of God are holy and the miracle honours their holiness, which can be hidden but never lost.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.32">
    <p class=native>32.&emsp;I inspire all miracles, which are really intercessions. 2They intercede for your holiness and make your perceptions holy. 3By placing you beyond the physical laws they raise you into the sphere of celestial order. 4In this order you are perfect.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.33">
    <p class=native>33.&emsp;Miracles honour you because you are loveable. 2They dispel illusions about yourself and perceive the light in you. 3They thus atone for your errors by freeing you from your nightmares. 4By releasing your mind from the imprisonment of your illusions, they restore your sanity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.34">
    <p class=native>34.&emsp;Miracles restore the mind to its fullness. 2By atoning for lack they establish perfect protection. 3The spirit’s strength leaves no room for intrusions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.35">
    <p class=native>35.&emsp;Miracles are expressions of love, but they may not always have observable effects.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.36">
    <p class=native>36.&emsp;Miracles are examples of right thinking, aligning your perceptions with truth as God created it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.37">
    <p class=native>37.&emsp;A miracle is a correction introduced into false thinking by me. 2It acts as a catalyst, breaking up erroneous perception and reorganising it properly. 3This places you under the Atonement principle, where perception is healed. 4Until this has occurred, knowledge of the Divine Order is impossible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.38">
    <p class=native>38.&emsp;The Holy Spirit is the mechanism of miracles. 2He recognises both God’s creations and your illusions. 3He separates the true from the false by His ability to perceive totally rather than selectively.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.39">
    <p class=native>39.&emsp;The miracle dissolves error because the Holy Spirit identifies error as false or unreal. 2This is the same as saying that by perceiving light, darkness automatically disappears.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.40">
    <p class=native>40.&emsp;The miracle acknowledges everyone as your brother and mine. 2It is a way of perceiving the universal mark of God.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.41">
    <p class=native>41.&emsp;Wholeness is the perceptual content of miracles. 2They thus correct, or atone for, the faulty perception of lack.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.42">
    <p class=native>42.&emsp;A major contribution of miracles is their strength in releasing you from your false sense of isolation, deprivation and lack.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.43">
    <p class=native>43.&emsp;Miracles arise from a miraculous state of mind, or a state of miracle-readiness.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.44">
    <p class=native>44.&emsp;The miracle is an expression of an inner awareness of Christ and the acceptance of His Atonement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.45">
    <p class=native>45.&emsp;A miracle is never lost. 2It may touch many people you have not even met, and produce undreamed of changes in situations of which you are not even aware.</p>

    <p class=native>46.&emsp;The Holy Spirit is the highest communication medium. 2Miracles do not involve this type of communication, because they are temporary communication devices. 3When you return to your original form of communication with God by direct revelation, the need for miracles is over.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.47">
    <p class=native>47.&emsp;The miracle is a learning device that lessens the need for time. 2It establishes an out-of-pattern time interval not under the usual laws of time. 3In this sense it is timeless.</p>  
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.48">
    <p class=native>48.&emsp;The miracle is the only device at your immediate disposal for controlling time. 2Only revelation transcends it, having nothing to do with time at all.</p> 
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.49">
    <p class=native>49.&emsp;The miracle makes no distinction among degrees of misperception. 2It is a device for perception correction, effective quite apart from either the degree or the direction of the error. 3This is its true indiscriminateness.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=paragraph id="T-1.I.50">
    <p class=native>50.&emsp;The miracle compares what you have made with creation, accepting what is in accord with it as true, and rejecting what is out of accord as false.</p>
