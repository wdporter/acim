    <p class=fip>5.&emsp;Error cannot really threaten truth, which can always withstand it. <sup>2</sup>Only the error is actually vulnerable. <sup>3</sup>You are free to establish your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is inevitable if you remember this:</p>
    <blockquote><sup>4</sup>Spirit is in a state of grace forever.<br><sup>5</sup>Your reality is only spirit.<br><sup>6</sup>Therefore you are in a state of grace forever.</blockquote>
    <p class=fip><sup>7</sup>Atonement undoes all errors in this respect, and thus uproots the source of fear. <sup>8</sup>Whenever you experience God’s reassurances as threat, it is always because you are defending misplaced or misdirected loyalty. <sup>9</sup>When you project this to others you imprison them, but only to the extent to which you reinforce errors they have already made. <sup>10</sup>This makes them vulnerable to the distortions of others, since their own perception of themselves is distorted. <sup>11</sup>The miracle worker can only bless them, and this undoes their distortions and frees them from prison.</p>
