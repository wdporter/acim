    <p class=fip>1.&emsp;Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear. <sup>2</sup>It reflects the original form of communication between God and His creations, involving the extremely personal sense of creation sometimes sought in physical relationships. <sup>3</sup>Physical closeness cannot achieve it. <sup>4</sup>Miracles, however, are genuinely interpersonal, and result in true closeness to others. <sup>5</sup>Revelation unites you directly with God. <sup>6</sup>Miracles unite you directly with your brother. <sup>7</sup>Neither emanates from consciousness, but both are experienced there. <sup>8</sup>Consciousness is the state that induces action, though it does not inspire it. <sup>9</sup>You are free to believe what you choose, and what you do attests to what you believe.</p>

    <p class=simplified>Miracles unite us with our brother. Revelation unites us with God. Revelation is the original communication with God. There is no doubt or fear in revelation. In revelation we understand creation. We act according our beliefs.</p>

    <p class=fip>2.&emsp;Revelation is intensely personal and cannot be meaningfully translated. <sup>2</sup>That is why any attempt to describe it in words is impossible. <sup>3</sup>Revelation induces only experience. <sup>4</sup>Miracles, on the other hand, induce action. <sup>5</sup>They are more useful now because of their interpersonal nature. <sup>6</sup>In this phase of learning, working miracles is important because freedom from fear cannot be thrust upon you. <sup>7</sup>Revelation is literally unspeakable because it is an experience of unspeakable love.</p>

    <p class=simplified>Revelation is an experience of love and freedom from fear. Revelation cannot be spoken about. Miracles are useful actions for others, until we are ready for revelation.</p>

      <p class=fip>3.&emsp;Awe should be reserved for revelation, to which it is perfectly and correctly applicable. <sup>2</sup>It is not appropriate for miracles because a state of awe is worshipful, implying that one of a lesser order stands before his Creator. <sup>3</sup>You are a perfect creation, and should experience awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection. <sup>4</sup>The miracle is therefore a sign of love among equals. <sup>5</sup>Equals should not be in awe of one another because awe implies inequality. <sup>6</sup>It is therefore an inappropriate reaction to me. <sup>7</sup>An elder brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience, and obedience for his greater wisdom. <sup>8</sup>He is also entitled to love because he is a brother, and to devotion if he is devoted. <sup>9</sup>It is only my devotion that entitles me to yours. <sup>10</sup>There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. <sup>11</sup>I have nothing that does not come from God. <sup>12</sup>The difference between us now is that I have nothing else. <sup>13</sup>This leaves me in a state which is only potential in you.</p>

      <p class=simplified>Awe is for revelation. Miracles are for others. Love, respect, obedience, devotion are due an elder brother. Jesus has only what is from God. We have the potential to be like Jesus. </p>

      <p class=commentary>[Jesus], our loving elder brother. (Wapnick, AAC, p. 197)</p>

      <p class=commentary>Jesus consistently teaches in the course that he is no different from us in reality, but in the illusory and symbolic world of time he can be our teacher and guide if we allow him to be that for us. (Wapnick, AAC, p. 214)</p>

      <p class=commentary>Jesus is unlike us in having no ego thoughts of separation — guilt, fear or attack — to cloud his mind of the clear light of Christ. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 517, 518)</p>
