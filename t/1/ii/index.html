    <p class=native>1.&emsp;Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear. <sup>2</sup>It reflects the original form of communication between God and His creations, involving the extremely personal sense of creation sometimes sought in physical relationships. <sup>3</sup>Physical closeness cannot achieve it. <sup>4</sup>Miracles, however, are genuinely interpersonal, and result in true closeness to others. <sup>5</sup>Revelation unites you directly with God. <sup>6</sup>Miracles unite you directly with your brother. <sup>7</sup>Neither emanates from consciousness, but both are experienced there. <sup>8</sup>Consciousness is the state that induces action, though it does not inspire it. <sup>9</sup>You are free to believe what you choose, and what you do attests to what you believe.</p>
