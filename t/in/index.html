    <p class=expanded>1.&emsp;This is a course in miracles. <sup>2</sup>It [the course] is a required course.
      <sup>3</sup> Only the time you take it [the course] is voluntary. <sup>4</sup>Free will does not mean that you can
      establish the curriculum. <sup>5</sup>It [Free will] means only that you can elect what you want to take at a
      given time. <sup>6</sup>The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that [the meaning of love] is
      beyond what can be taught. <sup>7</sup>It [the course] does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness
      of love’s presence, which [love’s presence] is your natural inheritance. <sup>8</sup>The opposite of love is fear,
      but what is all-encompassing [love] can have no opposite.</p>

    <p class=simplified>This is a course in miracles. The Course is required. But you can choose when to take it. The
      course does not teach the meaning of love. Instead the course teaches how to remove the blocks to the awareness of
      love’s presence. The opposite of love is fear. But love encompasses everything.</p>

    <p class=expanded>2.&emsp;This course [A Course in Miracles] can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:</p>
    <p class="expanded indented emphasis">
      <sup>2</sup>Nothing real can be threatened.<br>
      <sup>3</sup>Nothing unreal exists.
    </p>
    <p class=expanded>
      <sup>4</sup>Herein [Here in the course] lies the peace of God.

    <p class=substituted>2.&emsp;A Course in Miracles can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:</p>
    <p class="substituted more-indented emphasis">
      <sup>2</sup>Nothing real can be threatened.<br>
      <sup>3</sup>Nothing unreal exists.
    </p>
    <p class=substituted>
      <sup>4</sup>Here in the course lies the peace of God.

    <p class=simplified>Summary: What’s real never changes, so what’s real can’t be threatened. Anything that can change doesn’t actually exist. True peace is knowing the difference.</p>
