In-1. This is a course in miracles. 2 It is a required course. 3 Only the time you take it is voluntary. 4 Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. 5 It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. 6 The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. 7 It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of loveâ€™s presence, which is your natural inheritance. 8 The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.

In-2. This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:

2 Nothing real can be threatened.
3 Nothing unreal exists.
4 Herein lies the peace of God.
