    <p class=simplified>This is a course in miracles. The Course is required. But you can choose when to take it. The
      course does not teach the meaning of love. Instead the course teaches how to remove the blocks to the awareness of
      love’s presence. The opposite of love is fear. But love encompasses everything.</p>

    <p class=simplified>Summary: The real never changes, so the real can’t be threatened. Anything that can change
      doesn’t actually exist. True peace is knowing this.</p>
