This is a course in miracles. The lessons are required. You choose when to take the lessons. The course does not teach the meaning of love. The course teaches how to remove the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence. The opposite of love is fear. But love love is all-encompassing. Love has no opposite.

The real never changes, so the real can’t be threatened. Anything that can change doesn’t actually exist. True peace is knowing this.

::: tab Note
The ‘real’ is that which never changes, or that which has ‘necessary’ as opposed to ‘contingent’ existence. Or in Buddhist philosopy, that which has ‘inherent’ existence.

If it never changes, it can’t be threatened.
