1.&emsp;Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear. 
²It reflects the original form of communication between God and His creations, involving the extremely personal sense of creation sometimes sought in physical relationships. 
³Physical closeness cannot achieve it. 
⁴Miracles, however, are genuinely interpersonal, and result in true closeness to others. 
⁵Revelation unites you directly with God. 
⁶Miracles unite you directly with your brother. 
⁷Neither emanates from consciousness, but both are experienced there. 
⁸Consciousness is the state that induces action, though it does not inspire it. 
⁹You are free to believe what you choose, and what you do attests to what you believe.

2.&emsp;Revelation is intensely personal and cannot be meaningfully translated. 
²That is why any attempt to describe it in words is impossible. 
³Revelation induces only experience. 
⁴Miracles, on the other hand, induce action. 
⁵They are more useful now because of their interpersonal nature. 
⁶In this phase of learning, working miracles is important because freedom from fear cannot be thrust upon you. 
⁷Revelation is literally unspeakable because it is an experience of unspeakable love.

3.&emsp;Awe should be reserved for revelation, to which it is perfectly and correctly applicable. 
²It is not appropriate for miracles because a state of awe is worshipful, implying that one of a lesser order stands before his Creator. 
³You are a perfect creation, and should experience awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection. 
⁴The miracle is therefore a sign of love among equals. 
⁵Equals should not be in awe of one another because awe implies inequality. 
⁶It is therefore an inappropriate reaction to me. 
⁷An elder brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience, and obedience for his greater wisdom. 
⁸He is also entitled to love because he is a brother, and to devotion if he is devoted. 
⁹It is only my devotion that entitles me to yours. 
¹⁰There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. 
¹¹I have nothing that does not come from God. 
¹²The difference between us now is that I have nothing else. 
¹³This leaves me in a state which is only potential in you.

<!--::: details Commentary
(5–6) Jesus, thus, is the one who first completed his Atonement path. He began with us, believing in the reality of the separated world of the ego. Now, having learned his lessons perfectly and completely, he reaches back to help us walk forgiveness’ path, as he did. In the Course, he asks that we think of him as an elder brother. But he does not ask for awe … emphasising his equality with us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.286.)

(7–8) By Jesus’ transcending his ego identity, he and Christ became one. In this sense he *is* the Christ, for he is no longer his ego. … Thus we can say that we and Jesus are different in time, but not in eternity. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.286.)

(7–8) [Jesus], our loving elder brother. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p. 197.)

(7–12) Jesus is unlike us in having no ego thoughts of separation — guilt, fear or attack — to cloud his mind of the clear light of Christ. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p. 517, 518.) (see T.1.II.4:5)

(7–4:7) Jesus consistently teaches in the course that he is no different from us in reality, but in the illusory and symbolic world of time he can be our teacher and guide if we allow him to be that for us. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.214.)

(10–4:1) Within the illusion of time, some people will seem to be closer to returning home … than others. The … category [Teacher of teachers] of course includes Jesus, who within the world of time is more advanced than any of us. But that is only within the illusion of time (c/f [t-1-iv-1](#t-1-iv-1) (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.130).

(13) By Jesus’ transcending his ego identity, he and Christ became one. In this sense he *is* the Christ, for he is no longer his ego… Thus we can say that we and Jesus are different in time, but not in eternity. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.286.)

4.&emsp;“No man comes unto the Father but by me” does not mean that I am in any way separate or different from you except in time, and time does not really exist. 
²The statement is more meaningful in terms of a vertical rather than a horizontal axis. 
³You stand below me and I stand below God. 
⁴In the process of ‘rising up’, I am higher because without me the distance between God and man would be too great for you to encompass. 
⁵I bridge the distance as an elder brother to you on the one hand, and as a Son of God on the other. 
⁶My devotion to my brothers has placed me in charge of the Sonship, which I render complete because I share it. 
⁷This may appear to contradict the statement “I and my Father are one”, but there are two parts to the statement in recognition that the Father is greater.

(1) [Jesus] is not “in any way separate or different” from us except in the world of time (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.449).

(3–5) …our role in this world, like Jesus’, is to manifest the Holy Spirit’s function of bridging time and eternity, remaining in the real world as He directs, our feet on the earth, while our hands reach to heaven. We are thus to become like Jesus, or those ascended masters who have completed their particular lessons. These teachers remain just a sliver away from Heaven, though they have its awreness, so that they help everyone else attain what they have learned. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 261.)

(3–6) Jesus became the Son of God, or Christ, by virtue of his having first completed his personal Atonement plan and helping us to do the same, but inherent in his nature is the Christ inherent in all of us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.286.)

(7) In one form or another, all of us fall prey  to this mistake of forgetting that we are … not God. This has been a fairly common characteristic of many contemporary spiritualities, where our spiritual Self is identified with the Self of the Creator. The course clarifies this: “Yet in creation you are not in reciprocal relation to God, since He created you but you did not create Him” [T-7.I.1:4](/text/7-the-gifts-of-the-kingdom#t-7-i-1). (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.263.)

(7) …there can be nothing in the Effect which is not in the Cause. Therefore, the Son cannot be different from his Father in attributes, excep tthat God is First Cause, and we as Christ are His Effect. That is the meaning of the biblical phrase Jesus quotes in the text: “I and my Father are one”. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.99).

³The Holy Spirit mediates higher to lower communication, keeping the direct channel from God to you open for revelation. 
⁴Revelation is not reciprocal. 
⁵It proceeds from God to you, but not from you to God.

6.&emsp;The miracle minimises the need for time. 
²In the longitudinal or horizontal plane the recognition of the equality of the members of the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time. 
³However, the miracle entails a sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception. 
⁴This introduces an interval from which the giver and receiver both emerge farther along in time than they would otherwise have been. 
⁵The miracle thus has the unique property of abolishing time to the extent that it renders the interval of time it spans unnecessary. 
⁶There is no relationship between the time a miracle takes and the time it covers. 
⁷The miracle substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands of years. 
⁸It does so by the underlying recognition of perfect equality of giver and receiver on which the miracle rests. 
⁹The miracle shortens time by collapsing it, thus eliminating certain intervals within it. 
¹⁰It does this, however, within the larger temporal sequence.

<!--::: details Commentary
(1–3) … within the framework of the ego system… reflects a linear process; namely that we moved away from God in the beginning, and now we have to return. That is why, though it talks about a journey *A Course in Miracles* very often reminds us that the journey is already over and that we *are* perfect in God. …this “return” [is discussed] in terms of the horizontal framework which is rooted in time, and the vertical one which transcends time and exists only in the present (the holy instant). (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.182.)

(7) *A Course in Miracles* talks a great deal about saving time. In fact, many times it talks about saving thousands of years. We are still talking about, in the world’s illusion of time, a considerable amount of time. The reason I am emphasising this is that I do not want you to feel guilty if you still have problems as you keep working with the Course. The real goal on the practical level of the Course is not to be free of problems, but to recognise what they are, and then to recognise within ourselves the means of undoing them. (Wapnick, A.T.G., p. 81.)
