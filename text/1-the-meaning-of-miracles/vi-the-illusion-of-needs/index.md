1. You who want peace can find it only by complete forgiveness. 
²No learning is acquired by anyone unless he wants to learn it and believes in some way that he needs it. 
³While lack does not exist in the creation of God, it is very apparent in what you have made. 
⁴It is, in fact, the essential difference between them. 
⁵Lack implies that you would be better off in a state somehow different from the one you are in. 
⁶Until the ‘separation’, which is the meaning of the ‘fall’, nothing was lacking. 
⁷There were no needs at all. 
⁸Needs arise only when you deprive yourself. 
⁹You act according to the particular order of needs you establish. 
¹⁰This, in turn, depends on your perception of what you are.

(3–8) The ego counsels us … to cannabalise what is outside of us, wresting it from another (or the world) and incorporating it within ourselves to fill the gaping hole of nothingness the ego has convinced us is our reality. Thus the orienting premise of the ego is the … scarcity principle: that we are missing something within, a lack that has its origin in the separation from God. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.488.; c/f A.A.C., p.123.)

2. A sense of separation from God is the only lack you really need correct. 
²This sense of separation would never have arisen if you had not distorted your perception of truth, and had thus perceived yourself as lacking. 
³The idea of order of needs arose because, having made this fundamental error, you had already fragmented yourself into levels with different needs. 
⁴As you integrate you become one, and your needs become one accordingly. 
⁵Unified needs lead to unified action, because this produces a lack of conflict.

You perceived yourself as lacking. 
You felt separated from God. 
You became fragmented by believing in different needs. 
Act only to restore oneness with God. God is all you need. 

[You only need God, but the moment you see yourself as lacking something, lacking *anything*, a sense of separation from God is introduced. This is the error to be undone. —Ed.]

3. The idea of orders of need, which follows from the original error that one can be separated from God, requires correction at its own level before the error of perceiving levels at all can be corrected. 
²You cannot behave effectively while you function on different levels. 
³However, while you do, correction must be introduced vertically from the bottom up. 
⁴This is because you think you live in space, where concepts such as ‘up’ and ‘down’ are meaningful. 
⁵Ultimately, space is as meaningless as time. 
⁶Both are merely beliefs.

⁴Belief produces the acceptance of existence.

The course urges us to look at the world benevolently: since we believe we are here, the world can be seen as kind, offering us itself as a classroom in which we learn the lessons that will lead us beyond the world entirely. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.575–576.)

5. All aspects of fear are untrue because they do not exist at the creative level, and therefore do not exist at all. 
²To whatever extent you are willing to submit your beliefs to this test, to that extent are your perceptions corrected. 
³In sorting out the false from the true, the miracle proceeds along these lines:

>⁴Perfect love casts out fear.  
⁵If fear exists,  
Then there is not perfect love.

⁶But:

>⁷Only perfect love exists.  
⁸If there is fear,  
It produces a state that does not exist.

⁹Believe this and you will be free.
