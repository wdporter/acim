::: tab Commentary  
(1) In the vision of Heaven, there can be no gradations of illusions or mistakes. Something either is or it is not. … Truth is true; all else is only a mistake which, when brought to truth, is gently corrected, not judged against and punished. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 186).  

(1) [It’s] a simple plan for salvation that has no exceptions, [miracles] are all the same because there is likewise no hierarchy in illusions (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p. 562)  

(1) The first principle of miracles … counteracts the ego’s first law of chaos “there is a hierarchy of illusions” ([T–23.II.2:3](/text/23-the-war-against-yourself/#T-23.II.2)). (Wapnick, A.A.C., p. 58.)  

The very first principle of miracles that begins the text proper contains the whole thought system of the Course. In that sense the rest of the text is a commentary on this first principle which is the cornerstone of the teaching. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.15.)

::: tab Commentary
… the world of separation [is] made real, along with the seemingly infinite range of problems to be solved. Hence, the first principle of miracles — there is no order of difficulty among them — seems impossible and beyond our attainment. It is the purpose of *A Course in Miracles* to teach us that it is not only possible, but perfectly natural (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.51.)

This statement reflects the very practical nature of the Course. It is not teaching us simply the intellectual concept that time is an illusion; it is teaching us to recognise that all of our problems are the same. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.51.)

…they must first *decide* to accept God’s word. Demanding an external sign as proof of God is really believing in magic, since we must instead choose the miracle that reflects ourinternal shift. … Thus Jesus taught elsewhere, “Why does this generation demand a sign? I tell you solemnly, no sign shall be given to this generation” (*Mark* 8:12). No sign will be given because it would not be the loving or helpful thing to do, reïnforcing, as it where, the belief in magic which ultimately reïnforces the belief in separation. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 236–237.)

::: tab Commentary
Jesus clearly delineates the mutually exclusive nature of the levels of the mind and the body, and cautions his students against confusing them. Such confusion… is what is responsible for sickness. And it is the miracle that heals by redirecting the Son’s attention to the proper level — the mind instead of the body — wherein is found both the problem and the answer. Here are the relevant level-confusion passages (also principles [17](#t-1-i-17), [23](#t-1-i-23), [30](#t-1-i-30)) that highlights the dimension of the miracle or healing (the mind) and sickness (the body) (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.230–231)

:::
::: tab Commentary
…the miracle reflects the change of mind that enables us to let go of our guilt, the belief in our past sinfulness. This then frees the Holy Spritit to work through us in the sense that we are now allowing the extension of His Love to occur. In the words of [Lesson 194](/workbook/part-1/194-i-place-the-future-in-the-hands-of-god): “I place the future in the hands of God”. This is not possible as long as we hold on to the ego’s guilt. It *is* possible, of course, when we let go of the guilt, and that is what releases the future. The “beginning and the ending” that is referred to can be understood as the beginning and the ending of a relationship. The “beginning” would be the special relationship that the ego has made real, while the “ending” is the forgiveness of that relationship — making it holy. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 123.)

::: tab Commentary
(2–4) …the course urges us to look at the world benevolently: since we believe we are here, the world can be seen as kind, offering us iteself as a classroom in which we learn the lessons that will lead us beyond the world entirely … These lines echo the spirit of Origen, for whom the world was also a classroom. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C. p. 575–6.)

The point here is that the ego made time as a way of trapping us, reïnforcing our belief that separation and guilt are real, and so our fear of punishment is justified. The Holy Spirit, though, uses time in His own way within the illusion, so that He teaches us something else. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 123–124.)

Time is used by the Holy Spirit as a ‘teaching device’ not because it is real, but because it is a means whereby we can learn. When we have learned our lessons time will disappear. As time was not made by God, it is not eternal, lasting only as long as the dream that gave rise to it is accorded reality. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 125.)

::: tab Commentary
(5–6) Jesus, thus, is the one who first completed his Atonement path. He began with us, believing in the reality of the separated world of the ego. Now, having learned his lessons perfectly and completely, he reaches back to help us walk forgiveness’ path, as he did. In the Course, he asks that we think of him as an elder brother. But he does not ask for awe … emphasising his equality with us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.286.)

(7–8) By Jesus’ transcending his ego identity, he and Christ became one. In this sense he *is* the Christ, for he is no longer his ego. … Thus we can say that we and Jesus are different in time, but not in eternity. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.286.)

(7–8) [Jesus], our loving elder brother. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p. 197.)

(7–12) Jesus is unlike us in having no ego thoughts of separation — guilt, fear or attack — to cloud his mind of the clear light of Christ. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p. 517, 518.) (see T.1.II.4:5)

(7–4:7) Jesus consistently teaches in the course that he is no different from us in reality, but in the illusory and symbolic world of time he can be our teacher and guide if we allow him to be that for us. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.214.)

(10–4:1) Within the illusion of time, some people will seem to be closer to returning home … than others. The … category [Teacher of teachers] of course includes Jesus, who within the world of time is more advanced than any of us. But that is only within the illusion of time (c/f [t-1-iv-1](#t-1-iv-1) (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.130).

(13) By Jesus’ transcending his ego identity, he and Christ became one. In this sense he *is* the Christ, for he is no longer his ego… Thus we can say that we and Jesus are different in time, but not in eternity. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.286.)

(1) [Jesus] is not “in any way separate or different” from us except in the world of time (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.449).

(3–5) …our role in this world, like Jesus’, is to manifest the Holy Spirit’s function of bridging time and eternity, remaining in the real world as He directs, our feet on the earth, while our hands reach to heaven. We are thus to become like Jesus, or those ascended masters who have completed their particular lessons. These teachers remain just a sliver away from Heaven, though they have its awreness, so that they help everyone else attain what they have learned. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 261.)

(3–6) Jesus became the Son of God, or Christ, by virtue of his having first completed his personal Atonement plan and helping us to do the same, but inherent in his nature is the Christ inherent in all of us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.286.)

(7) In one form or another, all of us fall prey  to this mistake of forgetting that we are … not God. This has been a fairly common characteristic of many contemporary spiritualities, where our spiritual Self is identified with the Self of the Creator. The course clarifies this: “Yet in creation you are not in reciprocal relation to God, since He created you but you did not create Him” [T-7.I.1:4](/text/7-the-gifts-of-the-kingdom#T-7.I.1). (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.263.)

(7) …there can be nothing in the Effect which is not in the Cause. Therefore, the Son cannot be different from his Father in attributes, excep tthat God is First Cause, and we as Christ are His Effect. That is the meaning of the biblical phrase Jesus quotes in the text: “I and my Father are one”. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.99).

::: tab Commentary
(1–3) … within the framework of the ego system… reflects a linear process; namely that we moved away from God in the beginning, and now we have to return. That is why, though it talks about a journey *A Course in Miracles* very often reminds us that the journey is already over and that we *are* perfect in God. …this “return” [is discussed] in terms of the horizontal framework which is rooted in time, and the vertical one which transcends time and exists only in the present (the holy instant). (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.182.)

(7) *A Course in Miracles* talks a great deal about saving time. In fact, many times it talks about saving thousands of years. We are still talking about, in the world’s illusion of time, a considerable amount of time. The reason I am emphasising this is that I do not want you to feel guilty if you still have problems as you keep working with the Course. The real goal on the practical level of the Course is not to be free of problems, but to recognise what they are, and then to recognise within ourselves the means of undoing them.

Be ready and willing to do miracles. Doing more miracles brings more conviction. Miracles are for Atonement.

::: tab Commentary
(1) Atonement corrects the error of separation, which holds that God was the victim of the Son’s attack, who them became the victim of his Father’s justified vengeance. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.189.)

(1) The life of Jesus was [an] ‘act of love’, for he was the ‘thought’ within the separated mind that first remembered his relationship with God and Identity as Christ (along with the rest of the Sonship). He has been ‘placed’ by the Holy Spirit as head of the overall plan, in charge of the Sonship and the Atonement. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.514.) c/f [t-1-iii-4:1](#t-1-iii-4), [T-2.II.4:2–5](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement#T-2.II.4).

(1) When the Atonement is complete and the Sonship awakens from the dream, the Second Coming of Christ dawns. And Jesus is asking us to join in that process with him, which he “undertook to begin”. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.228)

(1) This ‘appointment’ of Jesus occurred on quite a different level since there is no time, and all of what we know as time is happening in this one instant, *now*, which we merely reëxperience within our minds. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.206.)

(1, 4) It is precisely his function of being in charge of the process of Atonement that we need (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.293.)

(1) Guilt arises from sin, which the Couse defines at one point as lack of love, the post-separation condition. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 16.)

(4) Until the moment of birth, the fetus has little or no awareness of itself as a separate being. It does not desire, since its basic physiological needs are met by and through the mother. In this respect, and this respect only, life in the womb is similar to the state of paradise described in the second chapter of Genesis where Adam wanted for nothing, all having been given by God, reflecting what *A Course in Miracles* refers to as the principle of abundance. In a state without lack there can be no sense of separation or “otherness”. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.100.)

::: tab Commentary
(4) Since guilt makes God into an ememy, recognising our dependency on Him, which we have denied, can only occur when our inherent guiltlessness as God’s children is accepted. At this point, we are able to identify with our invulnerability as spirit, the prerequisite for forgiveness. This quotation of Jesus does not refer to the so-called innocence of children. As we have seen, children are born into the world with the same fullly developed egos we experience as adults. The perceived “innocence” is nothing more than the projection of the innocence that we feel has been lost in the infancy of the ego’s exsitence, when the separation occurred. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 171.)

(6) Without guilt’s demand to see others as separate from us, we are free to affirm our inherent unity in the Sonship of God …  Jesus’ lack of ego enabled him to have no special relationships. In his perception, none of his brothers or sisters was special. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.184.)

(6) The we–they battlefield … hating and attacking the other group … Thus its [the Course’s] students often confuse form with content, and forget Jesus’ statement in the text that “All my brothers are special” (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.590.)

(6) The “special” person of the Course is Jesus or the Holy Spirit; that is, the internal presence of God’s love that, again, leads Jesus to state that all his “brothers are special”.  (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.593.)

(6) The true teacher of God … is not one with a *special* mission, nor a *special* gift to give others *special* messages of wisdom. Rather, it is to remind others of the choice they may make to separate filnally from the ego’s specialness and to join Jesus’ love. Thus Jesus in reïnforcing for his students the idea that no one is more special than any other. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 111.)
