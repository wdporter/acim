::: tab Commentary  
(1) In the vision of Heaven, there can be no gradations of illusions or mistakes. Something either is or it is not. … Truth is true; all else is only a mistake which, when brought to truth, is gently corrected, not judged against and punished. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 186).  

(1) [It’s] a simple plan for salvation that has no exceptions, [miracles] are all the same because there is likewise no hierarchy in illusions (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 562)  

(1) The first principle of miracles … counteracts the ego’s first law of chaos “there is a hierarchy of illusions” ([T–23.II.2:3](/text/23-the-war-against-yourself/#T-23.II.2)). (Wapnick, AAC, p. 58.)  

The very first principle of miracles that begins the text proper contains the whole thought system of the Course. In that sense the rest of the text is a commentary on this first principle which is the cornerstone of the teaching. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.15.)

::: tab Commentary
… the world of separation [is] made real, along with the seemingly infinite range of problems to be solved. Hence, the first principle of miracles — there is no order of difficulty among them — seems impossible and beyond our attainment. It is the purpose of *A Course in Miracles* to teach us that it is not only possible, but perfectly natural (Wapnick, AVI, p.51.)

This statement reflects the very practical nature of the Course. It is not teaching us simply the intellectual concept that time is an illusion; it is teaching us to recognise that all of our problems are the same. (Wapnick, AVI, p.51.)

…they must first *decide* to accept God’s word. Demanding an external sign as proof of God is really believing in magic, since we must instead choose the miracle that reflects ourinternal shift. … Thus Jesus taught elsewhere, “Why does this generation demand a sign? I tell you solemnly, no sign shall be given to this generation” (*Mark* 8:12). No sign will be given because it would not be the loving or helpful thing to do, reïnforcing, as it where, the belief in magic which ultimately reïnforces the belief in separation.

::: tab Commentary
Jesus clearly delineates the mutually exclusive nature of the levels of the mind and the body, and cautions his students against confusing them. Such confusion… is what is responsible for sickness. And it is the miracle that heals by redirecting the Son’s attention to the proper level — the mind instead of the body — wherein is found both the problem and the answer. Here are the relevant level-confusion passages (also principles [17](#T-1.I.17), [23](#T-1.I.23), [30](#T-1.I.30)) that highlights the dimension of the miracle or healing (the mind) and sickness (the body) (Wapnick AAC p.230–231)

:::
::: tab Commentary
…the miracle reflects the change of mind that enables us to let go of our guilt, the belief in our past sinfulness. This then frees the Holy Spritit to work through us in the sense that we are now allowing the extension of His Love to occur. In the words of [Lesson 194](/workbook/part-1/194-i-place-the-future-in-the-hands-of-god): “I place the future in the hands of God”. This is not possible as long as we hold on to the ego’s guilt. It *is* possible, of course, when we let go of the guilt, and that is what releases the future. The “beginning and the ending” that is referred to can be understood as the beginning and the ending of a relationship. The “beginning” would be the special relationship that the ego has made real, while the “ending” is the forgiveness of that relationship — making it holy. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 123.)

::: tab Commentary
(2–4) …the course urges us to look at the world benevolently: since we believe we are here, the world can be seen as kind, offering us iteself as a classroom in which we learn the lessons that will lead us beyond the world entirely … These lines echo the spirit of Origen, for whom the world was also a classroom. (Wapnick, LDNC p. 575–6.)

The point here is that the ego made time as a way of trapping us, reïnforcing our belief that separation and guilt are real, and so our fear of punishment is justified. The Holy Spirit, though, uses time in His own way within the illusion, so that He teaches us something else. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 123–124.)

Time is used by the Holy Spirit as a ‘teaching device’ not because it is real, but because it is a means whereby we can learn. When we have learned our lessons time will disappear. As time was not made by God, it is not eternal, lasting only as long as the dream that gave rise to it is accorded reality. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 125.)

But he does not ask for awe … emphasising his equality with us. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.286.)

That is why, though it talks about a journey *A Course in Miracles* very often reminds us that the journey is already over and that we *are* perfect in God. …this “return” [is discussed] in terms of the horizontal framework which is rooted in time, and the vertical one which transcends time and exists only in the present (the holy instant).

(7) *A Course in Miracles* talks a great deal about saving time. In fact, many times it talks about saving thousands of years. We are still talking about, in the world’s illusion of time, a considerable amount of time. The reason I am emphasising this is that I do not want you to feel guilty if you still have problems as you keep working with the Course. The real goal on the practical level of the Course is not to be free of problems, but to recognise what they are, and then to recognise within ourselves the means of undoing them.

(4) Until the moment of birth, the fetus has little or no awareness of itself as a separate being. It does not desire, since its basic physiological needs are met by and through the mother. In this respect, and this respect only, life in the womb is similar to the state of paradise described in the second chapter of Genesis where Adam wanted for nothing, all having been given by God, reflecting what *A Course in Miracles* refers to as the principle of abundance. In a state without lack there can be no sense of separation or “otherness”. (Wapnick, AAC, p.100.)

(4) Since guilt makes God into an ememy, recognising our dependency on Him, which we have denied, can only occur when our inherent guiltlessness as God’s children is accepted. At this point, we are able to identify with our invulnerability as spirit, the prerequisite for forgiveness. This quotation of Jesus does not refer to the so-called innocence of children. As we have seen, children are born into the world with the same fullly developed egos we experience as adults. The perceived “innocence” is nothing more than the projection of the innocence that we feel has been lost in the infancy of the ego’s exsitence, when the separation occurred. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 171.)

(6) Without guilt’s demand to see others as separate from us, we are free to affirm our inherent unity in the Sonship of God …  Jesus’ lack of ego enabled him to have no special relationships. In his perception, none of his brothers or sisters was special. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.184.)

(6) The true teacher of God … is not one with a <em>special</em> mission, nor a <em>special</em> gift to give others <em>special</em> messages of wisdom.

<sup>5</sup>Without preparation, you may become much too fearful of what is to come to make constructive use of the course. 
<sup>6</sup>However, as you study these earlier sections, you will begin to see some of the implications that will be amplified later on.
	
#### simplifed 

This is a course in mind training. Learning involves attention and study. Study these early sections carefully. Without preparation now you may be fearful later on.

(1) …the text …explains this paradoxical situation to us of being “at home in God, [yet] dreaming of exile” (<a href="/text/10/I#p2">T-10.I.2:1</a>): how this insane belief in separation seemd to arise in our <em>minds</em>, how it is maintained in our <em>minds</em>, and how it finally is undone in our <em>minds</em>. <em>A Course in Miracles</em> is thus … a “mind training” curriculum designed to help us change our thought system from the ego’s to the Holy Spirit’s.

(4) …many students emphasise the workbook at the expense of the text, rather than viewing each book as a companion to the other. The mistake here … reflects the unconscious error of believing that our ego identification is weak and can be easily discarded, leaving our minds open to recieve — instantaneously and joyously — the Word of God.

<p class=fip id=p5>
5.&emsp;A solid foundation is necessary because of the confusion between fear and awe to which I have already referred, and which is often made. 
<sup>2</sup>I have said that awe is inappropriate in connection with the Sons of God, because you should not experience awe in the presence of your equals. 
<sup>3</sup>However, it was also emphasised that awe is proper in the Presence of your Creator. 
<sup>4</sup>I have been careful to clarify my role in the Atonement without either over- or understating it. 
<sup>5</sup>I am also trying to do the same with yours. 
<sup>6</sup>I have stressed that awe is not an appropriate reaction to me because of our inherent equality. 
<sup>7</sup>Some of the later steps in this course, however, involve a more direct approach to God Himself. 
<sup>8</sup>It would be unwise to start on these steps without careful preparation, or awe will be confused with fear, and the experience will be more traumatic than beatific. 
<sup>9</sup>Healing is of God in the end. 
<sup>10</sup>The means are being carefully explained to you. 
<sup>11</sup>Revelation may occasionally reveal the end to you, but to reach it the means are needed.

#### simplifed 
We have an equal role in the Atonement. Awe and fear should not be confused. Fear is to be healed. Awe is proper towards God. Later steps in the course involve a direct approach to God. 

 
#### commentary

:::tip
(para 4–5) In the last two paragraphs of the first chapter of the text, we read of the need to go very slowly and carefully through all of the material, including the first four chapters. If we do not, we will not be prepared for what will come later, and we will become afraid of it. (Wapnick, ATG, p.107.)
