1.&emsp;I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. 
²When you offer a miracle to any of my brothers, you do it to *yourself* and me. 
³The reason you come before me is that I do not need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you fail temporarily. 
⁴My part in the Atonement is the cancelling out of all errors that you could not otherwise correct. 
⁵When you have been restored to the recognition of your original state, you naturally become part of the Atonement yourself. 
⁶As you share my unwillingness to accept error in yourself and others, you must join the great crusade to correct it: listen to my voice, learn to undo error and act to correct it. 
⁷The power to work miracles belongs to you. 
⁸I will provide the opportunities to do them, but you must be ready and willing. 
⁹Doing them will bring conviction in the ability, because conviction comes through accomplishment. 
¹⁰The ability is the potential, the achievement is its expression, and the Atonement, which is the natural profession of the children of God, is the purpose.

<!--::: details Commentary
(1) Atonement corrects the error of separation, which holds that God was the victim of the Son’s attack, who them became the victim of his Father’s justified vengeance. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.189.)

(1) The life of Jesus was [an] ‘act of love’, for he was the ‘thought’ within the separated mind that first remembered his relationship with God and Identity as Christ (along with the rest of the Sonship). He has been ‘placed’ by the Holy Spirit as head of the overall plan, in charge of the Sonship and the Atonement. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.514.) c/f [t-1-iii-4:1](#t-1-iii-4), [T-2.II.4:2–5](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement#t-2-ii-4).

(1) When the Atonement is complete and the Sonship awakens from the dream, the Second Coming of Christ dawns. And Jesus is asking us to join in that process with him, which he “undertook to begin”. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.228)

(1) This ‘appointment’ of Jesus occurred on quite a different level since there is no time, and all of what we know as time is happening in this one instant, *now*, which we merely reëxperience within our minds. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.206.)

(1, 4) It is precisely his function of being in charge of the process of Atonement that we need (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.293.)

4.&emsp;I am the only one who can perform miracles indiscriminately, because I am the Atonement. 
²You have a role in the Atonement which I will dictate to you. 
³Ask me which miracles you should perform. 
⁴This spares you needless effort, because you will be acting under direct communication. 
⁵The impersonal nature of the miracle is an essential ingredient, because it enables me to direct its application, and under my guidance miracles lead to the highly personal experience of revelation. 
⁶A guide does not control but he does direct, leaving it up to you to follow. 
⁷“Lead us not into temptation” means “Recognise your errors and choose to abandon them by following my guidance”.

5.&emsp;Error cannot really threaten truth, which can always withstand it. 
²Only the error is actually vulnerable. 
³You are free to establish your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is inevitable if you remember this:

>⁴Spirit is in a state of grace forever.  
⁵Your reality is only spirit.  
⁶Therefore you are in a state of grace forever.

⁷Atonement undoes all errors in this respect, and thus uproots the source of fear. 
⁸Whenever you experience God’s reässurances as threat, it is always because you are defending misplaced or misdirected loyalty. 
⁹When you project this to others you imprison them, but only to the extent to which you reïnforce errors they have already made. 
¹⁰This makes them vulnerable to the distortions of others, since their own perception of themselves is distorted. 
¹¹The miracle worker can only bless them, and this undoes their distortions and frees them from prison.
