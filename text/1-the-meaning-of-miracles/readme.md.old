Miracles are all the same to do. Love always expresses as much as it can.

::: details Commentary  
(1) In the vision of Heaven, there can be no gradations of illusions or mistakes. Something either is or it is not. … Truth is true; all else is only a mistake which, when brought to truth, is gently corrected, not judged against and punished. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 186).  

(1) [It’s] a simple plan for salvation that has no exceptions, [miracles] are all the same because there is likewise no hierarchy in illusions (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p. 562)  

(1) The first principle of miracles … counteracts the ego’s first law of chaos “there is a hierarchy of illusions” ([T–23.II.2:3](/text/23-the-war-against-yourself/#t-23-ii-2)). (Wapnick, A.A.C., p. 58.)  

The very first principle of miracles that begins the text proper contains the whole thought system of the Course. In that sense the rest of the text is a commentary on this first principle which is the cornerstone of the teaching. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.15.)

::: details Commentary
… the world of separation [is] made real, along with the seemingly infinite range of problems to be solved. Hence, the first principle of miracles — there is no order of difficulty among them — seems impossible and beyond our attainment. It is the purpose of *A Course in Miracles* to teach us that it is not only possible, but perfectly natural (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.51.)

This statement reflects the very practical nature of the Course. It is not teaching us simply the intellectual concept that time is an illusion; it is teaching us to recognise that all of our problems are the same. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.51.)

…they must first *decide* to accept God’s word. Demanding an external sign as proof of God is really believing in magic, since we must instead choose the miracle that reflects our internal shift. … Thus Jesus taught elsewhere, “Why does this generation demand a sign? I tell you solemnly, no sign shall be given to this generation” (*Mark* 8:12). No sign will be given because it would not be the loving or helpful thing to do, reïnforcing, as it where, the belief in magic which ultimately reïnforces the belief in separation. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 236–237.)

:::
::: details Commentary
Jesus clearly delineates the mutually exclusive nature of the levels of the mind and the body, and cautions his students against confusing them. Such confusion… is what is responsible for sickness. And it is the miracle that heals by redirecting the Son’s attention to the proper level — the mind instead of the body — wherein is found both the problem and the answer. Here are the relevant level-confusion passages (also principles [17](#t-1-i-17), [23](#t-1-i-23), [30](#t-1-i-30)) that highlights the dimension of the miracle or healing (the mind) and sickness (the body) (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.230–231)

:::
::: details Simplified
Miracles change time by changing beginnings and endings. Miracles allow rebirth. A rebirth does not change the past. A rebirth brings past and future into the present.
:::
::: details Commentary
…the miracle reflects the change of mind that enables us to let go of our guilt, the belief in our past sinfulness. This then frees the Holy Spritit to work through us in the sense that we are now allowing the extension of His Love to occur. In the words of [Lesson 194](/workbook/part-1/194-i-place-the-future-in-the-hands-of-god): “I place the future in the hands of God”. This is not possible as long as we hold on to the ego’s guilt. It *is* possible, of course, when we let go of the guilt, and that is what releases the future. The “beginning and the ending” that is referred to can be understood as the beginning and the ending of a relationship. The “beginning” would be the special relationship that the ego has made real, while the “ending” is the forgiveness of that relationship — making it holy. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 123.)

::: details Commentary
(2–4) …the course urges us to look at the world benevolently: since we believe we are here, the world can be seen as kind, offering us iteself as a classroom in which we learn the lessons that will lead us beyond the world entirely … These lines echo the spirit of Origen, for whom the world was also a classroom. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C. p. 575–6.)

The point here is that the ego made time as a way of trapping us, reïnforcing our belief that separation and guilt are real, and so our fear of punishment is justified. The Holy Spirit, though, uses time in His own way within the illusion, so that He teaches us something else. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 123–124.)

Time is used by the Holy Spirit as a ‘teaching device’ not because it is real, but because it is a means whereby we can learn. When we have learned our lessons time will disappear. As time was not made by God, it is not eternal, lasting only as long as the dream that gave rise to it is accorded reality. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 125.)

::: details Commentary
(1) Atonement corrects the error of separation, which holds that God was the victim of the Son’s attack, who them became the victim of his Father’s justified vengeance. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.189.)

(1) The life of Jesus was [an] ‘act of love’, for he was the ‘thought’ within the separated mind that first remembered his relationship with God and Identity as Christ (along with the rest of the Sonship). He has been ‘placed’ by the Holy Spirit as head of the overall plan, in charge of the Sonship and the Atonement. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.514.) c/f [t-1-iii-4:1](#t-1-iii-4), [T-2.II.4:2–5](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement#t-2-ii-4).

(1) When the Atonement is complete and the Sonship awakens from the dream, the Second Coming of Christ dawns. And Jesus is asking us to join in that process with him, which he “undertook to begin”. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.228)

(1) This ‘appointment’ of Jesus occurred on quite a different level since there is no time, and all of what we know as time is happening in this one instant, *now*, which we merely reëxperience within our minds. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.206.)

(1) Guilt arises from sin, which the Couse defines at one point as lack of love, the post-separation condition. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 16.)

(4) Until the moment of birth, the fetus has little or no awareness of itself as a separate being. It does not desire, since its basic physiological needs are met by and through the mother. In this respect, and this respect only, life in the womb is similar to the state of paradise described in the second chapter of Genesis where Adam wanted for nothing, all having been given by God, reflecting what *A Course in Miracles* refers to as the principle of abundance. In a state without lack there can be no sense of separation or “otherness”. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.100.)

(4) Since guilt makes God into an ememy, recognising our dependency on Him, which we have denied, can only occur when our inherent guiltlessness as God’s children is accepted. At this point, we are able to identify with our invulnerability as spirit, the prerequisite for forgiveness. This quotation of Jesus does not refer to the so-called innocence of children. As we have seen, children are born into the world with the same fullly developed egos we experience as adults. The perceived “innocence” is nothing more than the projection of the innocence that we feel has been lost in the infancy of the ego’s exsitence, when the separation occurred. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 171.)

(6) Without guilt’s demand to see others as separate from us, we are free to affirm our inherent unity in the Sonship of God …  Jesus’ lack of ego enabled him to have no special relationships. In his perception, none of his brothers or sisters was special. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.184.)

(6) The we–they battlefield … hating and attacking the other group … Thus its [the Course’s] students often confuse form with content, and forget Jesus’ statement in the text that “All my brothers are special” (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.590.)

(6) The “special” person of the Course is Jesus or the Holy Spirit; that is, the internal presence of God’s love that, again, leads Jesus to state that all his “brothers are special”.  (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.593.)

(6) The true teacher of God … is not one with a *special* mission, nor a *special* gift to give others *special* messages of wisdom. Rather, it is to remind others of the choice they may make to separate filnally from the ego’s specialness and to join Jesus’ love. Thus Jesus in reïnforcing for his students the idea that no one is more special than any other. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 111.)

You who want peace can find peace only by complete forgiveness. ²No learning is acquired by anyone unless anyone wants learning and believes in some way that anyone needs learning. ³While lack does not exist in the creation of God, lack is very apparent in what you have made. ⁴Lack is, in fact, the essential difference between the creation of God and what you have made. ⁵Lack implies that you would be better off in a state somehow different from the state you are in. ⁶Until the ‘separation’, which is the meaning of the ‘fall’, nothing was lacking. ⁷There were no needs at all. ⁸Needs arise only when you deprive yourself. ⁹You act according to the particular order of needs you establish. ¹⁰The order of needs you establish, in turn, depends on your perception of what you are.

God’s creations have no lack. You deprived yourself by separating from God. Forgive yourself and see yourself truly.

(3–8) The ego counsels us … to cannabalise what is outside of us, wresting it from another (or the world) and incorporating it within ourselves to fill the gaping hole of nothingness the ego has convinced us is our reality. Thus the orienting premise of the ego is the … scarcity principle: that we are missing something within, a lack that has its origin in the separation from God.
