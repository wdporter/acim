<sup>2</sup>Time can waste as well as be wasted. 
<sup>3</sup>The miracle worker, therefore, accepts the time-control factor gladly. 
<sup>4</sup>He recognises that every collapse of time brings everyone closer to the ultimate release from time, in which the Son and the Father are One. 
<sup>5</sup>Equality does not imply equality <em>now</em>. 
<sup>6</sup>When everyone recognises that he has everything, individual contributions to the Sonship will no longer be necessary.

Collapse time by recognising you have everything. Every collapse brings everyone closer to knowledge of oneness.

(1–5) We could use time on our behalf by regarding the world of linear time as a classroom in which we learn that there is no time. (Wapnick, AVI, p.129.)

All are children of God. All are dependent on God. All share God’s gifts equally. All are special. Do not believe you are deprived of anything. Believing in deprivation distorts perceptions. Distorted perceptions create distorted relationships.

#### commentary

:::tip
(4) Since guilt makes God into an ememy, recognising our dependency on Him, which we have denied, can only occur when our inherent guiltlessness as God’s children is accepted. At this point, we are able to identify with our invulnerability as spirit, the prerequisite for forgiveness. This quotation of Jesus does not refer to the so-called innocence of children. As we have seen, children are born into the world with the same fullly developed egos we experience as adults. The perceived “innocence” is nothing more than the projection of the innocence that we feel has been lost in the infancy of the ego’s exsitence, when the separation occurred. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 171.)
:::

:::tip
(6) Without guilt’s demand to see others as separate from us, we are free to affirm our inherent unity in the Sonship of God …  Jesus’ lack of ego enabled him to have no special relationships. In his perception, none of his brothers or sisters was special. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.184.)
:::

:::tip
(6) The we–they battlefield … hating and attacking the other group … Thus its [the Course’s] students often confuse form with content, and forget Jesus’ statement in the text that “All my brothers are special” (Wapnick, LDNC, p.590.)
:::tip

:::tip 
(6) The “special” person of the Course is Jesus or the Holy Spirit; that is, the internal presence of God’s love that, again, leads Jesus to state that all his “brothers are special”.  (Wapnick, LDNC, p.593.)
:::

:::tip
(6) The true teacher of God … is not one with a <em>special</em> mission, nor a <em>special</em> gift to give others <em>special</em> messages of wisdom. Rather, it is to remind others of the choice they may make to separate filnally from the ego’s specialness and to join Jesus’ love. Thus Jesus in re-inforcing for his students the idea that no one is more special than any other. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 111.)

(3–4) God is not mocked because His creation of you will have the last word — no matter how sinful you appear to become, you cannot change the holiness He created in you. (C of A, p. 31.)

<sup>2</sup>Spirit is therefore unalterable because it is already perfect, but the mind can elect what it chooses to serve. 
<sup>3</sup>The only limit put on its choice is that it cannot serve two masters.
