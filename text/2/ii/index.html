		1.&emsp;You can do anything I ask.

		<sup>5</sup>Remember that where your heart is, there is your treasure also. 
		<sup>6</sup>You believe in what you value. 
		<sup>7</sup>If you are afraid, you are valuing wrongly. 
		<sup>8</sup>Your understanding will then inevitably value wrongly, and by endowing all thoughts with equal power will inevitably destroy peace. 
		<sup>9</sup>That is why the Bible speaks of “the peace of God which passes understanding”. 
		<sup>10</sup>This peace is totally incapable of being shaken by errors of any kind. 
		<sup>11</sup>It denies the ability of anything not of God to affect you. 
		<sup>12</sup>This is the proper use of denial. 
		<sup>13</sup>It is not used to hide anything, but to correct error. 
		<sup>14</sup>It brings all error into the light, and since error and darkness are the same, it corrects error automatically.

		2.&emsp;True denial is a powerful protective device. 
		<sup>2</sup>You can and should deny any belief that error can hurt you. 
		<sup>3</sup>This kind of denial is not a concealment but a correction. 
		<sup>4</sup>Your right mind depends on it. 
		<sup>5</sup>Denial of error is a strong defence of truth, but denial of truth results in miscreation, the projections of the ego. 
		<sup>6</sup>In the service of the right mind the denial of error frees the mind, and re-establishes the freedom of the will. 
		<sup>7</sup>When the will is really free it cannot miscreate, because it recognises only truth.

		3.&emsp;You can defend truth as well as error. 
		<sup>2</sup>The means are easier to understand after the value of the goal is firmly established. 
		<sup>3</sup>It is a question of what it [the goal] is <em>for</em>. 
		<sup>4</sup>Everyone defends his [one’s] treasure, and will do so [defend one’s treasure] automatically. 
		<sup>5</sup>The real questions are, what do you treasure, and how much do you treasure it [what you treasure]? 
		<sup>6</sup>Once you have learned to consider these questions and to bring them [these questions] into all your actions, you will have little difficulty in clarifying the means. 
		<sup>7</sup>The means are available whenever you ask. 
		<sup>8</sup>You can, however, save time if you do not protract this step unduly. 
		<sup>9</sup>The correct focus will shorten it [time] immeasurably.
