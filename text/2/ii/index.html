	<p class=simplified>You can do anything I ask. I have asked you to perform miracles. I have made it clear that miracles are natural, corrective, healing and universal. There is nothing miracles cannot do. But miracles cannot be performed in the spirit of doubt or fear. When you are afraid of anything, you are acknowledging the thing’s power to hurt you. Remember that where your heart is, there is your treasure also. You believe in what you value. If you are afraid, you are valuing wrongly. Your understanding will then inevitably value wrongly. Your understanding will endow all thoughts with equal power. Your understanding will inevitably destroy peace.  That is why the Bible speaks of “the peace of God which passes understanding”. The peace of God which passes understanding is totally incapable of being shaken by errors of any kind. The peace of God which passes understanding denies the ability of anything not of God to affect you. Denying the ability of anything not of God to affect you is the proper use of denial. Denying anything not of God can affect you is not used to hide anything, but to correct error. Denying anything not of God can affect you brings all error into the light. Error and darkness are the same. Denying anything not of God can affect you corrects error automatically.
