		1.&emsp;Before miracle workers are ready to undertake their function in this world, it is essential that they fully understand the fear of release. 
		<sup>2</sup>Otherwise they may unwittingly foster the belief that release is imprisonment, a belief that is already very prevalent. 
		<sup>3</sup>This misperception arises in turn from the belief that harm can be limited to the body. 
		<sup>4</sup>That is because of the underlying fear that the mind can hurt itself. 
		<sup>5</sup>None of these errors is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind do not really exist. 
		<sup>6</sup>This recognition is a far better protective device than any form of level confusion, because it introduces correction at the level of the error. 
		<sup>7</sup>It is essential to remember that only the mind can create, and that correction belongs at the thought level. 
		<sup>8</sup>To amplify an earlier statement, spirit is already perfect and therefore does not require correction. 
		<sup>9</sup>The body does not exist except as a learning device for the mind. 
		<sup>10</sup>This learning device is not subject to errors of its own, because it cannot create. 
		<sup>11</sup>It is obvious, then, that inducing the mind to give up its miscreations is the only application of creative ability that is truly meaningful.

		<sup>2</sup>Otherwise they [miracle workers] may unwittingly foster the belief that release is imprisonment, a belief that is already very prevalent. 
		<sup>3</sup>This misperception [release is imprisonment] arises in turn from the belief that harm can be limited to the body. 
		<sup>4</sup>That [believing release is imprisonment] is because of the underlying fear that the mind can hurt itself. 
		<sup>5</sup>None of these errors [mind can hurt itself, harm can be limited to the body, release is imprisonment] is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind do not really exist. 
		<sup>6</sup>This recognition [miscreations of the mind do not exist] is a far better protective device than any form of level confusion, because it [recognising miscreations of the mind do not exist] introduces correction at the level of the error.

		<sup>4</sup>Believing release is imprisonment is because of the underlying fear that the mind can hurt itself. 
		<sup>5</sup>None of the errors — mind can hurt itself, harm can be limited to the body, or release is imprisonment — is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind do not really exist. 
		<sup>6</sup>The recognition that miscreations of the mind do not exist is a far better protective device than any form of level confusion, because recognising miscreations of the mind do not exist introduces correction at the level of the error.

		<sup>11</sup>It is obvious, then, that inducing the mind to give up the mind’s miscreations is the only application of creative ability that is truly meaningful.
	<p class=simplified>Fear of release comes from believing the mind can hurt itself. The mind cannot hurt itself. The mind’s miscreations do not exist. The body is a learning device for the mind.

		2.&emsp;Magic is the mindless or the miscreative use of mind. 
		<sup>2</sup>Physical medications are forms of ‘spells’, but if you are afraid to use the mind to heal, you should not attempt to do so. 
		<sup>3</sup>The very fact that you are afraid makes your mind vulnerable to miscreation. 
		<sup>4</sup>You are therefore likely to misunderstand any healing that might occur, and because egocentricity and fear usually occur together, you may be unable to accept the real Source of the healing. 
		<sup>5</sup>Under these conditions, it is safer for you to rely temporarily on physical healing devices, because you cannot misperceive them as your own creations. 
		<sup>6</sup>As long as your sense of vulnerability persists, you should not attempt to perform miracles.

		3.&emsp;I have already said that miracles are expressions of miracle-mindedness, and miracle-mindedness means right-mindedness. 
		<sup>2</sup>The right-minded neither exalt nor depreciate the mind of the miracle worker or the miracle receiver. 
		<sup>3</sup>However, as a correction, the miracle need not await the right-mindedness of the receiver. 
		<sup>4</sup>In fact, its purpose is to restore him to his right mind. 
		<sup>5</sup>It is essential, however, that the miracle worker be in his right mind, however briefly, or he will be unable to re-establish right-mindedness in someone else.

		4.&emsp;The healer who relies on his own readiness is endangering his understanding. 
		<sup>2</sup>You are perfectly safe as long as you are completely unconcerned about your readiness, but maintain a consistent trust in mine. 
		<sup>3</sup>If your miracle working inclinations are not functioning properly, it is always because fear has intruded on your right-mindedness and has turned it upside down. 
		<sup>4</sup>All forms of not-right-mindedness are the result of refusal to accept the Atonement for yourself. 
		<sup>5</sup>If you do accept it, you are in a position to recognise that those who need healing are simply those who have not realised that right-mindedness <em>is</em> healing.
