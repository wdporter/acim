		1.&emsp;Being afraid seems to be involuntary; something beyond your own control. 
		<sup>2</sup>Yet I have said already that only constructive acts should be involuntary. 
		<sup>3</sup>My control can take over everything that does not matter, while my guidance can direct everything that does, if you so choose. 
		<sup>4</sup>Fear cannot be controlled by me, but it can be self-controlled. 
		<sup>5</sup>Fear prevents me from giving you my control. 
		<sup>6</sup>The presence of fear shows that you have raised body thoughts to the level of the mind. 
		<sup>7</sup>This removes them from my control, and makes you feel personally responsible for them. 
		<sup>8</sup>This is an obvious confusion of levels.

		<sup>8</sup>You cannot separate yourself from the truth by ‘giving’ autonomy to behaviour.

		<sup>10</sup>Whenever you are afraid, it is a sure sign that you have allowed your mind to miscreate and have not allowed me to guide it.

		5.&emsp;Fear is always a sign of strain, arising whenever what you want conflicts with what you do. 
		<sup>2</sup>This situation arises in two ways: First, you can choose to do conflicting things, either simultaneously or successively. 
		<sup>3</sup>This produces conflicted behaviour, which is intolerable to you because the part of the mind that wants to do something else is outraged. 
		<sup>4</sup>Second, you can behave as you think you should, but without entirely wanting to do so. 
		<sup>5</sup>This produces consistent behaviour, but entails great strain. 
		<sup>6</sup>In both cases, the mind and the behaviour are out of accord, resulting in a situation in which you are doing what you do not wholly want to do. 
		<sup>7</sup>This arouses a sense of coercion that usually produces rage, and projection is likely to follow. 
		<sup>8</sup>Whenever there is fear, it is because you have not made up your mind. 
		<sup>9</sup>Your mind is therefore split, and your behaviour inevitably becomes erratic. 
		<sup>10</sup>Correcting at the behavioural level can shift the error from the first to the second type, but will not obliterate the fear.

		<sup>4</sup>You have done something loveless, having chosen without love.

		<sup>6</sup>The need for the remedy inspired its establishment.

		A miracle recognises your true worth. Fear results when you choose without love and do loveless things. The Atonement is the remedy for fear. The Atonement re-establishes your true worth. True healing occurs by accepting the remedy.
