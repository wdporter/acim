		<sup>2</sup>Miracle working entails a full realisation of the power of thought in order to avoid miscreation.

		3.&emsp;Both miracles and fear come from thoughts. 
		<sup>2</sup>If you are not free to choose one, you would also not be free to choose the other. 
		<sup>3</sup>By choosing the miracle you <em>have</em> rejected fear, if only temporarily. 
		<sup>4</sup>You have been fearful of everyone and everything. 
		<sup>5</sup>You are afraid of God, of me and of yourself. 
		<sup>6</sup>You have misperceived or miscreated Us, and believe in what you have made. 
		<sup>7</sup>You would not have done this if you were not afraid of your own thoughts. 
		<sup>8</sup>The fearful <em>must</em> miscreate, because they misperceive creation. 
		<sup>9</sup>When you miscreate you are in pain. 
		<sup>10</sup>The cause and effect principle now becomes a real expediter, though only temporarily. 
		<sup>11</sup>Actually, ‘Cause’ is a term properly belonging to God, and His ‘Effect’ is His Son. 
		<sup>12</sup>This entails a set of Cause and Effect relationships totally different from those you introduce into miscreation. 
		<sup>13</sup>The fundamental conflict in this world, then, is between creation and miscreation. 
		<sup>14</sup>All fear is implicit in the second, and all love in the first. 
		<sup>15</sup>The conflict is therefore one between love and fear.

		4.&emsp;It has already been said that you believe you cannot control fear because you yourself made it, and your belief in it seems to render it out of your control. 
		<sup>2</sup>Yet any attempt to resolve the error through attempting the mastery of fear is useless. 
		<sup>3</sup>In fact, it asserts the power of fear by the very assumption that it need be mastered. 
		<sup>4</sup>The true resolution rests entirely on mastery through love. 
		<sup>5</sup>In the interim, however, the sense of conflict is inevitable, since you have placed yourself in a position where you believe in the power of what does not exist.

		5.&emsp;Nothing and everything cannot co-exist. 
		<sup>2</sup>To believe in one is to deny the other. 
		<sup>3</sup>Fear is really nothing and love is everything. 
		<sup>4</sup>Whenever light enters darkness, the darkness is abolished. 
		<sup>5</sup>What you believe is true for you. 
		<sup>6</sup>In this sense the separation <em>has</em> occurred, and to deny it is merely to use denial inappropriately. 
		<sup>7</sup>However, to concentrate on error is only a further error. 
		<sup>8</sup>The initial corrective procedure is to recognise temporarily that there is a problem, but only as an indication that immediate correction is needed. 
		<sup>9</sup>This establishes a state of mind in which the Atonement can be accepted without delay. 
		<sup>10</sup>It should be emphasised, however, that ultimately no compromise is possible between everything and nothing. 
		<sup>11</sup>Time is essentially a device by which all compromise in this respect can be given up. 
		<sup>12</sup>It only seems to be abolished by degrees, because time itself involves intervals that do not exist. 
		<sup>13</sup>Miscreation made this necessary as a corrective device. 
		<sup>14</sup>The statement “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life” needs only one slight correction to be meaningful in this context: “He gave it <em>to</em> His only begotten Son”.

	<p class=simplified>There is no fear. There is only love. You must first recognise that you believe in separation. Recognising the belief in separation is temporary. Then the belief in separation can be corrected. Separation is corrected by accepting the Atonement. Time is a learning device. Time is the gap that enables you to recognise the belief in separation before you accept the Atonement.

		6.&emsp;It should especially be noted that God has only one Son.

		<sup>5</sup>That is why the conflict cannot ultimately be resolved until all the parts of the Sonship have returned.

	<p class=commentary>The conflict is between there being only one Son while the Son has many parts. It is an error to believe either a) we are part of the Sonship but somehow incomplete; or b) we are separate, or apart from, or not a part of, the Sonship (Ed.)

		7.&emsp;I have already briefly spoken about readiness, but some additional points might be helpful here. 
		<sup>2</sup>Readiness is only the prerequisite for accomplishment. 
		<sup>3</sup>The two should not be confused. 
		<sup>4</sup>As soon as a state of readiness occurs, there is usually some degree of desire to accomplish, but it is by no means necessarily undivided. 
		<sup>5</sup>The state does not imply more than a potential for a change of mind. 
		<sup>6</sup>Confidence cannot develop fully until mastery has been accomplished. 
		<sup>7</sup>We have already attempted to correct the fundamental error that fear can be mastered, and have emphasised that the only real mastery is through love. 
		<sup>8</sup>Readiness is only the beginning of confidence. 
		<sup>9</sup>You may think this implies that an enormous amount of time is necessary between readiness and mastery, but let me remind you that time and space are under my control.
