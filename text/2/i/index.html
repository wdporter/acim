		1.&emsp;To extend is a fundamental aspect of God which He gave to His Son. 
		<sup>2</sup>In the creation, God extended Himself to His creations and imbued them with the same loving Will to create. 
		<sup>3</sup>You have not only been fully created, but have also been created perfect. 
		<sup>4</sup>There is no emptiness in you. 
		<sup>5</sup>Because of your likeness to your Creator you are creative. 
		<sup>6</sup>No child of God can lose this ability because it is inherent in what he is, but he can use it inappropriately by projecting. 
		<sup>7</sup>The inappropriate use of extension, or projection, occurs when you believe that some emptiness or lack exists in you, and that you can fill it with your own ideas instead of truth. 
		<sup>8</sup>This process involves the following steps:<br>
		&emsp;<sup>9</sup>First, you believe that what God created can be changed by your own mind.<br>
		&emsp;<sup>10</sup>Second, you believe that what is perfect can be rendered imperfect or lacking.<br>
		&emsp;<sup>11</sup>Third, you believe that you can distort the creations of God, including yourself.<br>
		&emsp;<sup>12</sup>Fourth, you believe that you can create yourself, and that the direction of your own creation is up to you.

	<p class=simplified>You are God’s Son. You are creative. You misuse creativity by projecting. You project because you believe you lack something. You believe you can create yourself.
