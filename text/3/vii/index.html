		2.&emsp;You cannot resolve the authority problem by depreciating the power of your mind. 
		<sup>2</sup>To do so is to deceive yourself, and this will hurt you because you really understand the strength of the mind. 
		<sup>3</sup>You also realise that you cannot weaken it, any more than you can weaken God. 
		<sup>4</sup>The ‘devil’ is a frightening concept because he seems to be extremely powerful and extremely active. 
		<sup>5</sup>He is perceived as a force in combat with God, battling Him for possession of His creations. 
		<sup>6</sup>The devil deceives by lies, and builds kingdoms in which everything is in direct opposition to God. 
		<sup>7</sup>Yet he attracts men rather than repels them, and they are willing to ‘sell’ him their souls in return for gifts of no real worth. 
		<sup>8</sup>This makes absolutely no sense.

		3.&emsp;We have discussed the fall or separation before, but its meaning must be clearly understood. 
		<sup>2</sup>The separation is a system of thought real enough in time, though not in eternity. 
		<sup>3</sup>All beliefs are real to the believer. 
		<sup>4</sup>The fruit of only one tree was ‘forbidden’ in the symbolic garden. 
		<sup>5</sup>But God could not have forbidden it, or it could not have <em>been</em> eaten. 
		<sup>6</sup>If God knows His children, and I assure you that He does, would He have put them in a position where their own destruction was possible? 
		<sup>7</sup>The ‘forbidden tree’ was named the “tree of knowledge”. 
		<sup>8</sup>Yet God created knowledge and gave it freely to His creations. 
		<sup>9</sup>The symbolism here has been given many interpretations, but you may be sure that any interpretation that sees either God or His creations as capable of destroying Their Own purpose is in error.

		4.&emsp;Eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is a symbolic expression for usurping the ability for self-creating. 
		<sup>2</sup>This is the only sense in which God and His creations are not co-creators.

		<sup>9</sup>Until then, however, the belief that you can is the foundation stone in your thought system, and all your defences are used to attack ideas that might bring it to light.

		<sup>11</sup>Your mind is split with the Holy Spirit on this point, and there is no resolution while you believe the one thing that is literally inconceivable. 
		<sup>12</sup>That is why you cannot create and are filled with fear about what you make.

		5.&emsp;The mind can make the belief in separation very real and very fearful, and this belief <em>is</em> the ‘devil’.

		<sup>5</sup>Your creation by God is the only Foundation that cannot be shaken, because the light is in it.

	<p class=simplified>The foundation of your thought system is a false belief in separation. Your thought system is your life. Your true foundation is that God created you. This is your real beginning. Go back to your beginning. At the beginning your Self is in peace. Nothing has truly happened since the beginning. Do not be afraid about the destruction of your thought system, that is, your life. 

	<p class=commentary>(1–4) For ‘the devil’, read ‘the belief in separation’ (—Ed.) 

	<p class="commentary wapnick">(1) Crucial to the Course’s understanding of salvation is that it is not “the world, the flesh and the devil” from which one needs to be saved, for that is not the problem. Rather, the problem is the underlying thought system of separation — the way we think — that brought about the world, the flesh and the devil. It is this “way of thinking” that we may more properly call the devil, it being nothing more than our belief that it is possible to have a force that opposes God, and that can succeed. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 499–500.)

	<p class=commentary>(sections <a href=/text/3/vi>VI</a> and VII) Once we see through the filter of the past, we cannot see the light of Christ that shines in others. Rather, we shall see around them only a shoadow of the guilt which <em>we</em> have put there. We put it there because we have projected it from our minds as a magical atttempt to escape from the guilt of <em>our</em> past. An example of this is people who have unresolved problems with their fathers, and with authority figures in general, who then see any authority figure as if that person were their father. The ultimate origin of the authority problem of course is our belief in the separation from God, the only Authrority. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 170.)
