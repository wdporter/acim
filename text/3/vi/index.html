		<sup>2</sup>After the Last Judgement there will be no more. 
		<sup>3</sup>Judgement is symbolic because beyond perception there is no judgement.

	<p class=simplified>In perception we judge others and judge ourselves. After the Last Judgement there will be no more judgement.

	<p class=commentary>(4) The decision to attack another is really the decision to hold onto our guilt through the dynamic of projection. Thus, it is not so much the judgement we shall receive from the outside that is the warning here, but the judgement we would make against ourselves by attacking another, re-inforcing our own guilt. This is always the ego’s hidden motive: to retain our guilt by projecting it onto others. Jesus’ words, as elsewhere, should not be taken as a threat of God’s punishment or vengeance, but rather as a caution on the threat of punishment and vengeance we incur upon ourselves, which re-inforces the belief in our own sinfulness. Of such is <em>not</em> the Kingdom of Heaven. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 175. c/f <a href=/text/25/viii#p13>T-25.VIII.13:3</a>)

		2.&emsp;The choice to judge rather than to know is the cause of the loss of peace. 
		<sup>2</sup>Judgement is the process on which perception but not knowledge rests. 
		<sup>3</sup>I have discussed this before in terms of the selectivity of perception, pointing out that evaluation is its obvious prerequisite. 
		<sup>4</sup>Judegment always involves rejection. 
		<sup>5</sup>It never emphasises only the positive aspects of what is judged, whether in you or in others. 
		<sup>6</sup>What has been perceived and rejected, or judged and found wanting, remains in your mind because it has been perceived. 
		<sup>7</sup>One of the illusions from which you suffer is the belief that what you judged against has no effect. 
		<sup>8</sup>This cannot be true unless you also believe that what you judged against does not exist. 
		<sup>9</sup>You evidently do not believe this, or you would not have judged against it. 
		<sup>10</sup>In the end it does not matter whether your judgment is right or wrong. 
		<sup>11</sup>Either way you are placing your belief in the unreal. 
		<sup>12</sup>This cannot be avoided in any type of judgement, because it implies the belief that reality is yours to select <em>from</em>.

		3.&emsp;You have no idea of the tremendous release and deep peace that comes from meeting yourself and your brothers totally without judgement. 
		<sup>2</sup>When you recognise what you are and what your brothers are, you will realise that judging them in any way is without meaning.

	<p class=simplified>Not judging brings peace. You do not need to judge. Giving up judgement enables perception to be given up.

	<p class=commentary>(1–3) …guiltlessness is in the Mind of the Father, it must be in our minds, too, beecause the Holy Spirit’s Love is the bridge that joins all our minds in one. Judging another or ourselves erases that innocence from our awareness, for judgement obviously means separation. Thus, our ego’s fear of the joining, marking the end of the thought of separation, leads us to choose judgement as the means of ‘protecting’ ourselves from the unifying Love of the Holy Spirit, reflected in this world by forgiveness. The great importance of giving up judgement as the prerequisite to peace is a major theme in the Course (Wapnick, AVI, p. 143.)

	<p class=commentary>(1) …the benefits of the Holy Spirit, meaning the benefits of letting go of our guilt and experiencing the peace that comes from truly trusting in each other. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 159.)

	<p class=commentary>(2) The Course states that the basis of our difficulties is the authority problem, a psychological concept which is redefined in religious terms. In the Course’s view this problem rests on the belief that we, rather than God, created ourselves. This strange belief is illustrated by the current emphasis in psychology on the ‘self-concept’, which implies that it is up to us to define and change our own reality as we see fit. This might be regarded as a modern versio of the situation found in the book of Genesis, in which Adam and Eve decided that they would be ‘other’ than God and have a will that was separated from His. … And indeed, most of us continually re-affirm the belief that we are separate from our Creator every second of our lives.

		8.&emsp;The issue of authority is really a question of authorship. 
		<sup>2</sup>When you have an authority problem, it is always because you believe you are the author of yourself and project your delusion onto others. 
		<sup>3</sup>You then perceive the situation as one in which others are literally fighting you for your authorship. 
		<sup>4</sup>This is the fundamental error of all those who believe they have usurped the power of God. 
		<sup>5</sup>This belief is very frightening to them, but hardly troubles God. 
		<sup>6</sup>He is, however, eager to undo it, not to punish His children, but only because He knows that it makes them unhappy.

		<sup>8</sup>Being uncertain of your true Authorship, you believe that your creation was anonymous. 
		<sup>9</sup>This leaves you in a position where it sounds meaningful to believe that you created yourself.
