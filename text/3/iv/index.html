		<sup>3</sup>This is because you are not certain how you will use them, and are therefore incapable of knowledge. 
		<sup>4</sup>You are also incapable of knowledge because you can still perceive lovelessly. 
		<sup>5</sup>Perception did not exist until the separation introduced degrees, aspects and intervals.

		<sup>8</sup>The levels created by the separation cannot but conflict. 
		<sup>9</sup>This is because they are meaningless to each other.

		2.&emsp;Consciousness, the level of perception, was the first split introduced into the mind after the separation, making the mind a perceiver rather than a creator. 
		<sup>2</sup>Consciousness is correctly identified as the domain of the ego. 
		<sup>3</sup>The ego is a wrong-minded attempt to perceive yourself as you wish to be, rather than as you are. 
		<sup>4</sup>Yet you can know yourself only as you are, because that is all you can be sure of. 
		<sup>5</sup>Everything else <em>is</em> open to question.

	<p class=simplified>Before the separation, the mind was a creator. After the separation, the mind split. The split mind became conscious, and began to perceive. Consciousness is the ego. The ego is wrong-minded. The ego sees you as you wish to be. What you are is all you can really know.</p>

		3.&emsp;The ego is the questioning aspect of the post-separation self, which was made rather than created. 
		<sup>2</sup>It is capable of asking questions but not of perceiving meaningful answers, because these would involve knowledge and cannot be perceived. 
		<sup>3</sup>The mind is therefore confused, because only One-mindedness can be without confusion. 
		<sup>4</sup>A separated or divided mind <em>must</em> be confused. 
		<sup>5</sup>It is necessarily uncertain about what it is. 
		<sup>6</sup>It has to be in conflict because it is out of accord with itself. 
		<sup>7</sup>This makes its aspects strangers to each other, and this is the essence of the fear-prone condition, in which attack is always possible. 
		<sup>8</sup>You have every reason to feel afraid as you perceive yourself. 
		<sup>9</sup>This is why you cannot escape from fear until you realise that you did not and could not create yourself. 
		<sup>10</sup>You can never make your misperceptions true, and your creation is beyond your own error. 
		<sup>11</sup>That is why you must eventually choose to heal the separation.

		4.&emsp;Right-mindedness is not to be confused with the knowing mind, because it is applicable only to right perception. 
		<sup>2</sup>You can be right-minded or wrong-minded, and even this is subject to degrees, clearly demonstrating that knowledge is not involved. 
		<sup>3</sup>The term “right-mindedness” is properly used as the correction for “wrong-mindedness”, and applies to the state of mind that induces accurate perception. 
		<sup>4</sup>It is miracle-minded because it heals misperception, and this is indeed a miracle in view of how you perceive yourself.

		5.&emsp;Perception always involves some misuse of mind, because it brings the mind into areas of uncertainty. 
		<sup>2</sup>The mind is very active. 
		<sup>3</sup>When it chooses to be separated it chooses to perceive. 
		<sup>4</sup>Until then it wills only to know. 
		<sup>5</sup>Afterwards it can only choose ambiguously, and the only way out of ambiguity is clear perception. 
		<sup>6</sup>The mind returns to its proper function only when it wills to know. 
		<sup>7</sup>This places it in the service of spirit, where perception is changed. 
		<sup>8</sup>The mind chooses to divide itself when it chooses to make its own levels. 
		<sup>9</sup>But it could not entirely separate itself from spirit, because it is from spirit that it derives its whole power to make or create. 
		<sup>10</sup>Even in miscreation the mind is affirming its Source, or it would merely cease to be. 
		<sup>11</sup>This is impossible, because the mind belongs to spirit which God created and which is therefore eternal.

	<p class=simplified>The mind wills to know. When the mind chooses to be separate, then the mind chooses to perceive. The mind returns to unity by a willingness to know. The mind can never be entirely separate. Creation is the mind’s nature. The separated mind miscreates, which is an attempt to create.

		6.&emsp;The ability to perceive made the body possible, because you must perceive <em>something</em> and <em>with</em> something. 
		<sup>2</sup>That is why perception involves an exchange or translation, which knowledge does not need. 
		<sup>3</sup>The interpretative function of perception, a distorted form of creation, then permits you to interpret the body as yourself in an attempt to escape from the conflict you have induced. 
		<sup>4</sup>Spirit, which knows, could not be reconciled with this loss of power, because it is incapable of darkness. 
		<sup>5</sup>This makes spirit almost inaccessible to the mind and entirely inaccessible to the body. 
		<sup>6</sup>Thereafter, spirit is perceived as a threat, because light abolishes darkness merely by showing you it is not there. 
		<sup>7</sup>Truth will always overcome error in this way. 
		<sup>8</sup>This cannot be an active process of correction because, as I have already emphasised, knowledge does not do anything. 
		<sup>9</sup>It can be perceived as an attacker, but it cannot attack. 
		<sup>10</sup>What you perceive as its attack is your own vague recognition that knowledge can always be remembered, never having been destroyed.
