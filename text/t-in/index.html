title: A Course in Miracles T-in

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>1.&emsp;This is a course in miracles. <sup>2</sup>It [the course] is a required course. <sup>3</sup> Only the time you take it [the course] is voluntary. <sup>4</sup>Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. <sup>5</sup>It [Free will] means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. <sup>6</sup>The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that [the meaning of love] is beyond what can be taught. <sup>7</sup>It [the course] does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence, which [love’s presence] is your natural inheritance. <sup>8</sup>The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing [love] can have no opposite.

<p class="indented emphasis">This is a course in miracles. The Course is required. But you can choose when to take it. The course does not teach the meaning of love. Instead the course teaches how to remove the blocks the awareness of love’s presence. If love could have an opposite, that opposite would be fear.
    
<p>2.&emsp;This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:
<p class="indented emphasis">
<sup>2</sup>Nothing real can be threatened.<br>
<sup>3</sup>Nothing unreal exists.
  
<p><sup>4</sup>Herein lies the peace of God.</p>

<p class="indented emphasis">Summary: Real means that which never changes. What can change doesn’t actually exist. True peace is knowing the difference.</p>
