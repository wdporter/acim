<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>T-in.1.&emsp;This is a course in miracles. <sup>2</sup>It [the course] is a required course. <sup>3</sup> Only the time you take it [the course] is voluntary. <sup>4</sup> Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. <sup>5</sup>It [Free will] means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. <sup>6</sup>The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that [the meaning of love] is beyond what can be taught. <sup>7</sup>It [The course] does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence, which [love’s presence] is your natural inheritance. <sup>8</sup>The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing [love] can have no opposite.</p>

<p>In-2. This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:
<br><br>
<sup>2</sup>Nothing real can be threatened.<br>
<sup>3</sup>Nothing unreal exists.<br>
<sup>4</sup>Herein lies the peace of God.<br>
