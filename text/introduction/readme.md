1.&emsp;This is a course in miracles. <sup>2</sup>It is a required course. <sup>3</sup>Only the time you take it is voluntary. <sup>4</sup>Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. <sup>5</sup>It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. <sup>6</sup>The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. <sup>7</sup>It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence, which is your natural inheritance. <sup>8</sup>The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.

#### simplified

This is a course in miracles. The lessons are required. You choose when to take the lessons. The course does not teach the meaning of love. The course teaches how to remove the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence. The opposite of love is fear. But love love is all-encompassing. Love has no opposite.

<sup>3</sup>Nothing unreal exists.
</span>
<sup>4</sup>Herein lies the peace of God.

#### simplified

The real never changes, so the real can’t be threatened. Anything that can change doesn’t actually exist. True peace is knowing this.

#### commentary

:::tip
(6) The ‘real’ is that which never changes, or that which has ‘necessary’ as opposed to ‘contingent’ existence. Or in Buddhist philosopy, that which has ‘inherent’ existence.  (—Ed.)
