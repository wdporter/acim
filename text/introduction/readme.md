#### simplified

This is a course in miracles. The lessons are required. You choose when to take the lessons. The course does not teach the meaning of love. The course teaches how to remove the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence. The opposite of love is fear. But love love is all-encompassing. Love has no opposite.

#### commentary

:::tip
(1) …that part of the script has already been filmed, and thus has already “happened”, but we are still free to choose <em>when</em> we will review it. This choice is the only notion of free will that the Course accepts as meaningful. (Wapnick, AVI, p.13.)
:::


:::tip
(1–2) …if the Course is a person’s path it should be followed; however, if it is not a suitable path, another would be found to serve the same purpose (Wapnick, LDNC p.12).
:::

:::tip
(1–5) We cannot establish the curriculum now because it has already been established by us. We can choose, though, what station, film, video tape or part of the kaleidoscope we are going to observe and re-experience at any given time. Yet what we are observing has already happened. The forms in which we are going to learn the curriculum have been chosen as well, as this passage indicates. (Wapnick, AVI, p.28–29.)
:::

:::tip
(2) What is “required” is the <em>universal</em> course, and that any particular form of it (such as <em>A Course in Miracles</em>) is required only for those to whom that form is assigned (C of A, p. 3).
:::

:::tip
(5)…what will be brought about is our awakening from the dream of the past, into the eternal present of God. The “choice” that is referred to is <em>when</em> people will choose to awaken from the dream. In other words, they can choose when they will press the right-minded button instead of the wrong-minded one, and choose finally to view and experience only happy dreams. (Wapnick, AVI, p.111.)
:::

:::tip
(6) …in this state [of perception] we cannot know what love really means — what love really <em>is</em>… once we remove our blocks to love, we pass beyond perception to what the Course calls knowledge, where we are one with the Mid of God (C of A. p.3)
:::

:::tip
(6–7) The central teaching of <em>A Course in Miracles</em> is not the love and unity that is our reality in Heaven, but rather the identifying and undoing of the guilt and fear — “protected” by our special relationships — that we believe to be our reality on earth (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 605).
:::

:::tip
(6–7) …a very important emphasis [is] placed in the Course on our not having to seek after the light, but rather to remove the interferences to the natural extension of this light through us …the love has been buried within our minds… (Wapnick, AVI, p.166.)
:::

:::tip
(6–7) Our true self does not need to be judged, but our illusory ego self needs to be judged as false, thereby clearing the way for the memory of our Identity as Christ to return to us. (Wapnick, AVI, p.246.)
:::

:::tip
(6–7) …the Course does not aim at having us learn what is positive or true, but rather at <em>un</em>learning the confusing thought system the ego has taught us in order to conceal and obscure the truth. …students of <em>A Course in Miracles</em> … are not asked to bring the truth of God’s Love to the illusions of the ego’s guilt and fear, but rather to bring the darkness of their ego’s specialness to the light of Jesus’ forgiveness. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.4.)
:::

:::tip
(6–7) Jesus teaches us in the Course that the truth about who we are is our Identity as Christ, and that this, in fact, has never changed. What <em>has</em> changed, however, is our belief in, and identification with this Self. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.12.)
:::

:::tip
(6–7) It is thus dwelling on specific answers to dualistic concerns, using Jesus for that purpose, that will end up ensuring that the student never passes beyond the early stages of the Course’s long-term process of letting go of the ego thought system through forgiveness. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 97.)
:::

:::tip
(6–7) The central teaching of <em>A Course in Miracles</em>, therfore, is not the love and unity that is our reality in Heaven, but rather the <em>identifying</em> and <em>undoing</em>of the guilt and fear — “protected” by our special relationships — that we believe to be our reality on earth. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 164.)
:::

:::tip
(7) True humility would have us welcome gladly the truth that in this world we have much to learn, and so we gratefully accept the spiritual tool and inner Guide that would teach us how to remove “the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence”, and return home to that Love (Wapnick, LDNC, p.612).
:::

:::tip
(7) We gratefully accept the spiritual tool and inner Guide that would teach us how to remove “the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence”, and return home at last to the Love that lies — liberally paraphrasing the inspiring words of Dante’s beatific vision of his <em>Commedia</em> — beyond the sun and all the other stars. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 173.)
:::

:::tip
(8) By denying the reality of the world (once seen as a miscreated dream), the God–World paradox disappears since what does not exist cannot be held antithetical to what does (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 457).
:::

:::tip
(8) …once one has had an experience of God’s non-dualistic Love, the inherently dualistic question — utlimately borne of fear or ignorance — could never be asked. (Wapnick, AAC, p. 24.)

“This is a manual for a special curriculum, intended for teachers of a special form of the universal course. There are many thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome” [M-1.4:1–2](/manual/1#p4).

“As the course emphasises, you are not free to choose the curriculum or even the form in which you will learn it. You are free, however, to decide when you want to learn it” [M-2.3:6–7](/manual/2#p3).

The real never changes, so the real can’t be threatened. Anything that can change doesn’t actually exist. True peace is knowing this.

#### commentary

:::tip
(2–4) God and Christ alone are real, and therefore cannot be threatened by the “tiny, mad idea” of separation that is not of God, and so cannot be real and does not exist. <em>Any</em> and <em>every</em> problem thus must also be non-existent, since a problem in the presence of God is inconceivable… The true “problem”, then, must lie in the <em>belief</em> there is a problem (Wapnick, LDNC, p.525, c/f AAC, p. 227.).
