1. One of the ways in which you can correct the magic–miracle confusion is to remember that you did not create yourself. 
²You are apt to forget this when you become egocentric, and this puts you in a position where a belief in magic is virtually inevitable. 
³Your will to create was given you by your Creator, Who was expressing the same Will in His creation. 
⁴Since creative ability rests in the mind, everything you create is necessarily a matter of will. 
⁵It also follows that whatever you alone make is real in your own sight, though not in the Mind of God. 
⁶This basic distinction leads directly into the real meaning of the Last Judgement.

You did not create yourself. 
If you believe you did create yourself you will believe in magic. 
Creating is an effect of the will. 
God gave you the will to create, just as God as the will to create. 
Magic is miscreation. 
Whatever you make alone is real to you but is not real to God.

2. The Last Judgement is one of the most threatening ideas in your thinking. 
²This is because you do not understand it. 
³Judgement is not an attribute of God. 
⁴It was brought into being only after the separation, when it became one of the many learning devices to be built into the overall plan. 
⁵Just as the separation occurred over millions of years, the Last Judgement will extend over a similarly long period, and perhaps an even longer one. 
⁶Its length can, however, be greatly shortened by miracles, the device for shortening but not abolishing time. 
⁷If a sufficient number become truly miracle-minded, this shortening process can be virtually immeasurable. 
⁸It is essential, however, that you free yourself from fear quickly, because you must emerge from the conflict if you are to bring peace to other minds.

God does not judge. 
Judgement is a learning device. 
The Last Judgement extends over time. 
You can shorten the process by miracles. 
Free yourself from fear and conflict to bring peace to other minds.

<!-- ##### commentary :::tip (1–4) The One-mindedness of God or Christ cannot judge, and thus God’s only judgement is not a judgement at all. … God’s judgement is simply the fact of His total Love for His beloved Sons. … In His [Holy Spirit’s] judgement there is no need to punish, simply to correct. Thus, the Holy Spirit's form of judgement is simply a way to re-unify the seemingly separated Sobnship. This is the “learning device” that was built into the overall plan. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.240.) :::
:::tip (5) It is really not likely to happen overnight. If you just thiink about how our world is constituted, there is a tremendous amount of frear that underlies and motivates every single aspect of it. Every institution, every system of thought within this world is motivated by fear and guilt. You just cannot change that right now. I think the plan of the Atonement and the Course’s part in it is to change individuals’ minds much more quickly than would otherwise happen. (Wapnick, ATG, p.102–10³.) :::
:::tip (5) …within the illusion of time, undoing the belief in separation will take long indeed. The tremendous amount of fear that is present in our minds seems to ensure that this is the case. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.241.) :::
::: 
:::tip (6–8) The more quickly we can make this choice [between miracles or grievances], the more quickly our minds can be healed; thus the more quickly Jesus can heal other minds through our own. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 241.) ::: -->

3. The Last Judgement is generally thought of as a procedure undertaken by God. 
²Actually it will be undertaken by my brothers with my help. 
³It is a final healing rather than a meting out of punishment, however much you may think that punishment is deserved. 
⁴Punishment is a concept totally opposed to right-mindedness, and the aim of the Last Judgement is to restore right-mindedness to you. 
⁵The Last Judgement might be called a process of right evaluation. 
⁶It simply means that everyone will finally come to understand what is worthy and what is not. 
⁷After this, the ability to choose can be directed rationally. 
⁸Until this distinction is made, however, the vacillations between free and imprisoned will cannot but continue.

<!-- ##### commentary :::tip (1–2) God cannot be involved in the Last Judgement because it is a correction for an error which He does not even know about. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 241.) :::
:::tip (³–6) At this final awakening we stand at the threshold of Heaven and look back at all the things we thought had been real, the entire span of time and space. We realise at last that everything we have made is false, and all that remains is the truth as God created it. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.242.) :::
:::tip (7–8) The individual process of learning right-minded judgements is what is referred to here. As this is learned and we accept the Atonemnt for ourselves, the vacillations between the ego and the Holy Spirit cease, so that our judgements are only those of the Holy Spirit. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.242.) ::: -->

4. The first step toward freedom involves a sorting out of the false from the true. 
²This is a process of separation in the constructive sense, and reflects the true meaning of the Apocalypse. 
³Everyone will ultimately look upon his own creations and choose to preserve only what is good, just as God Himself looked upon what He had created and knew that it was good. 
⁴At this point, the mind can begin to look with love on its own creations because of their worthiness. 
⁵At the same time the mind will inevitably disown its miscreations which, without belief, will no longer exist.

First sort out the false from the true. 
Sorting out the false from the true is constructive separation. 
Keep what is good. 
You can love what you made. 
Withdraw belief from your miscreations.

5. The term ‘Last Judgement’ is frightening not only because it has been projected onto God, but also because of the association of ‘last’ with death. 
²This is an outstanding example of upside-down perception. 
³If the meaning of the Last Judgement is objectively examined, it is quite apparent that it is really the doorway to life. 
⁴No one who lives in fear is really alive. 
⁵Your own last judgement cannot be directed toward yourself, because you are not your own creation. 
⁶You can, however, apply it meaningfully and at any time to everything you have made, and retain in your memory only what is creative and good. 
⁷This is what your right-mindedness cannot but dictate. 
⁸The purpose of time is solely to ‘give you time’ to achieve this judgement. 
⁹It is your own perfect judgement of your own perfect creations. 
¹⁰When everything you retain is loveable, there is no reason for fear to remain with you. 
¹¹This is your part in the Atonement.

<!-- ##### commentary :::tip (³) The Course’s understanding of the Last Judgement is that it is the instant when we make that final judgement separating out the illusions of the ego from the truth of God, and there thus remains nothing left to hinder our return home. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 244.) :::
:::tip (4) Living in fear is tantamount to identifying with the ego thought system which is, of course, the denial of life. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.245.) :::
:::tip (5–6) We cannot forgive our guilt by ourselves, but through forgiving others with the Holy Spirit’s help, our own guilt is undone. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.246.) :::
:::tip (7–11) When we forgive everything in this world, thereby forgiving ourselves, there will be no fear. The guilt that demands fear of God’s punishment would be gone: without its *cause* (guilt), the *effect* (fear) must disappear. And this undoing of our guilt and fear through forgiveness constitutes our role in the Atonement. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 247.) ::: -->
