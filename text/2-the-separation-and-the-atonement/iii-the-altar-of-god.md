#### simplified

You believe you need the body to attain Atonement. In separation, you defend the body against Atonement. You protect the body by making it into a temple. You must realise a temple is holy because of the altar inside. Spiritual sight will show you the true altar.

2.&emsp;For perfect effectiveness the Atonement belongs at the centre of the inner altar, where it undoes the separation and restores the wholeness of the mind. 
<sup>2</sup>Before the separation the mind was invulnerable to fear, because fear did not exist. 
<sup>3</sup>Both the separation and the fear are miscreations that must be undone for the restoration of the temple, and for the opening of the altar to receive the Atonement. 
<sup>4</sup>This heals the separation by placing within you the one effective defence against all separation thoughts and making you perfectly invulnerable.

Fear did not exist before the separation. Separation and fear must be undone. The Atonement is the defence against separation thoughts.

<sup>2</sup>This may appear to contradict free will because of the inevitability of the final decision, but this is not so. 
<sup>3</sup>You can temporise and you are capable of enormous procrastination, but you cannot depart entirely from your Creator, Who set the limits on your ability to miscreate.

<sup>7</sup>As this recognition becomes more firmly established, it becomes a turning point. 
<sup>8</sup>This ultimately reawakens spiritual vision, simultaneously weakening the investment in physical sight. 
<sup>9</sup>The alternating investment in the two levels of perception is usually experienced as conflict, which can become very acute. 
<sup>10</sup>But the outcome is as certain as God.

(4–8) And what allows the Presence of God in our minds — the Holy Spirit or Jesus — to undo the ego’s seemingly invincible plot is the pain that we feel from our original and ongoing decision to remain separate from the Love of God, a decision that enables us to exist as an individual. It is this discomfort over our unhappy situation (referred to as having “an imporsioned will”) that impels us finally to ask for “a better way”. … Realising that our way has not worked… we call upon the “better way”, which means calling upon the better Teacher.

Spiritual vision looks past error and sees truth. Spiritual vision awakens the mind. The mind becomes more sensitive to error and pain.

#### commentary

:::tip
(1–4) The Atonement undoes guilt simply by moving past it to the guiltlessness underneath. …our forgiveness of each other is the means through which God reminds us that we are guiltless as His Children. This is the Holy Spirit’s plan of the Atonement: I acknowledge the guiltlessness of the Son of God in you, and this awareness, shared with you in my mind, teaches me that that guiltlessness is what I am as well. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 146.)

:::tip
(7) This sensitivity [to our deepest self], however, can become a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows us to turn over to Jesus our ego temptations, but on the other, it causes us to react even to the slightest ego stirrings. What really happens is that things we would have never noticed before now stick out like sore thumbs, a situation where “the mind becomes increasingly sensitive to what the mind would once have regarded as very minor intrusions of discomfort”. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.260.)

#### commentary

:::tip
(11) God, of course, cannot weep or be lonely, but these references reflect both His love for us and the Holy Spirit’s desire that we return to our Father and be free from the pain of believing we are still separate from Him. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.215.) (see [T-5.VII.4:5]("text/5-healing-and-wholeness/vii-the-decision-for-god#p4))
:::	

:::tip
(11) Clearly, since God is abstract and does not have a body, He does not get lonely, nor weep; as He is the All, He cannot be incomplete. Further, the very idea that He could be any of these things clearly implies that the separation of His Son from Himself has actually happened, and this of course is directly antithetical to the Course’s teachings. The point that is being made, therefore, has to be understood on the level of the *content* of God’s love for His children (itself of course an anthropocentric metaphor), expressd through the *form* of an earthly father’s love for his child. Since we are still very much children in the spiritual life —  “You are very new in the ways of salvation” ([T-17.V.9:1](/text/17-forgiveness-and-the-holy-relationship/v-the-healed-relationship#p9)), *A Course in Miracles* tells us — the Course’s use of language at this level is more than appropriate. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 608.)
