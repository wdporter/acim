³I know it does not exist, but you do not. 
⁴If I intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a basic law of cause and effect; the most fundamental law there is. 
⁵I would hardly help you if I depreciated the power of your own thinking. 
⁶This would be in direct opposition to the purpose of this course. 
⁷It is much more helpful to remind you that you do not guard your thoughts carefully enough. 
⁸You may feel that at this point it would take a miracle to enable you to do this, which is perfectly true. 
⁹You are not used to miracle-minded thinking, but you can be trained to think that way. 
¹⁰All miracle workers need that kind of training.

(1–6) What Jesus and the Holy Spirit *do* do, however, is teach us that we have made a mistake in our thinking, which has resulted in the problem of fear that we have now externalised. They have come to us to represent another way of thinking, that we may choose again. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.123.)

(4–5) One cannot undo fear by reducing or underestimating the power of the mind. If the power of our mind which chose mistakenly is not honoured and respected, then we are denying that very mind the power to correct itself through the Holy Spirit. We would have successfully denied the only means for our salvation — our power of decision — its efficacy to save us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.2³8.) see [T-2.VI.1:4](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vi-fear-and-conflict), [T-2.VI.4:1–4](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vi-fear-and-conflict#4).

(4–6) Jesus is exhorting his students to pay careful attention to their mind’s decision to be unhappy, and to correct that *cause*, rather than continually seeking his help in remedying the *effect*, which ultimately makes no sense at all. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 6.)

2. I cannot let you leave your mind unguarded, or you will not be able to help me. 
²Miracle working entails a full realisation of the power of thought in order to avoid miscreation. 
³Otherwise a miracle will be necessary to set the mind itself straight, a circular process that would not foster the time collapse for which the miracle was intended. 
⁴The miracle worker must have genuine respect for true cause and effect as a necessary condition for the miracle to occur.

⁵You are afraid of God, of me and of yourself. 
⁶You have misperceived or miscreated Us, and believe in what you have made. 
⁷You would not have done this if you were not afraid of your own thoughts. 
⁸The fearful *must* miscreate, because they misperceive creation. 
⁹When you miscreate you are in pain. 
¹⁰The cause and effect principle now becomes a real expediter, though only temporarily. 
¹¹Actually, ‘Cause’ is a term properly belonging to God, and His ‘Effect’ is His Son. 
¹²This entails a set of Cause and Effect relationships totally different from those you introduce into miscreation. 
¹³The fundamental conflict in this world, then, is between creation and miscreation. 
¹⁴All fear is implicit in the second, and all love in the first. 
¹⁵The conflict is therefore one between love and fear.

4. It has already been said that you believe you cannot control fear because you yourself made it, and your belief in it seems to render it out of your control. 
²Yet any attempt to resolve the error through attempting the mastery of fear is useless. 
³In fact, it asserts the power of fear by the very assumption that it need be mastered. 
⁴The true resolution rests entirely on mastery through love. 
⁵In the interim, however, the sense of conflict is inevitable, since you have placed yourself in a position where you believe in the power of what does not exist.

5. Nothing and everything cannot coëxist. 
²To believe in one is to deny the other. 
³Fear is really nothing and love is everything. 
⁴Whenever light enters darkness, the darkness is abolished. 
⁵What you believe is true for you. 
⁶In this sense the separation *has* occurred, and to deny it is merely to use denial inappropriately. 
⁷However, to concentrate on error is only a further error. 
⁸The initial corrective procedure is to recognise temporarily that there is a problem, but only as an indication that immediate correction is needed. 
⁹This establishes a state of mind in which the Atonement can be accepted without delay. 
¹⁰It should be emphasised, however, that ultimately no compromise is possible between everything and nothing. 
¹¹Time is essentially a device by which all compromise in this respect can be given up. 
¹²It only seems to be abolished by degrees, because time itself involves intervals that do not exist. 
¹³Miscreation made this necessary as a corrective device. 
¹⁴The statement “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoëver believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life” needs only one slight correction to be meaningful in this context: “He gave it *to* His only begotten Son”.

There is no fear. 
There is only love. 
You must first recognise that you believe in separation. 
Recognising the belief in separation is temporary. 
Then the belief in separation can be corrected. 
Separation is corrected by accepting the Atonement. 
Time is a learning device. 
Time is the gap that enables you to recognise the belief in separation before you accept the Atonement.

Rather, its central teaching is to forgive the world, loving it *for* its gift of forgiveness. … The world that God gave “to” us is the real world, which reflects the Holy Spirit’s purpose in helping us shift from the ego’s purpose for being here — hatred and separation — to the Holy Spirit’s of forgiveness and joining.

(1–3) Similarly, the Course talks about the Great Rays (not Ray), which are the extensions of the light of God, similar to the rays of light that emanate from the sun. … we may yet state that Christ consists of infinite Rays (Sons of God), all perfectly united and indivisible; however, we clearly are not speaking here of personal individuality as we experience it in the world.

²Readiness is only the prerequisite for accomplishment.

⁷We have already attempted to correct the fundamental error that fear can be mastered, and have emphasised that the only real mastery is through love.
