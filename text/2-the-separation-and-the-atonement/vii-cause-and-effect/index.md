<!-- ##### commentary :::tip (1–6)What Jesus and the Holy Spirit *do* do, however, is teach us that we have made a mistake in our thinking, which has resulted in the problem of fear that we have now externalised. They have come to us to represent another way of thinking, that we may choose again. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.12³.) :::
:::tip (4–5) One cannot undo fear by reducing or underestimating the power of the mind. If the power of our mind which chose mistakenly is not honoured and respected, then we are denying that very mind the power to correct itself through the Holy Spirit. We would have successfully denied the only means for our salvation — our power of decision — its efficacy to save us.

³Otherwise a miracle will be necessary to set the mind itself straight, a circular process that would not foster the time collapse for which the miracle was intended.

¹²It only seems to be abolished by degrees, because time itself involves intervals that do not exist.

¹⁴The statement “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life” needs only one slight correction to be meaningful in this context: “He gave it *to* His only begotten Son”.

²To believe in one is to deny the other. 
³Fear is really nothing and love is everything.

⁸The initial corrective procedure is to recognise temporarily that there is a problem, but only as an indication that immediate correction is needed.

##### Simplified

There is no fear. There is only love. You must first recognise that you believe in separation. Recognising the belief in separation is temporary. Then the belief in separation can be corrected. Separation is corrected by accepting the Atonement. Time is a learning device. Time is the gap that enables you to recognise the belief in separation before you accept the Atonement.

(14) *A Course in Miracles* does not teach that the world, the flesh and the devil are to be avoided, indulged in or fought against. Rather, its central teaching is to forgive the world, loving it *for* its gift of forgiveness. … The world that God gave “to” us is the real world, which reflects the Holy Spirit’s purpose in helping us shift from the ego’s purpose for being here — hatred and separation — to the Holy Spirit’s of forgiveness and joining.

²You are apt to forget this when you become egocentric, and this puts you in a position where a belief in magic is virtually inevitable. 
³Your will to create was given you by your Creator, Who was expressing the same Will in His creation. 
⁴Since creative ability rests in the mind, everything you create is necessarily a matter of will. 
⁵It also follows that whatever you alone make is real in your own sight, though not in the Mind of God. 
⁶This basic distinction leads directly into the real meaning of the Last Judgement.

You did not create yourself. If you believe you did create yourself you will believe in magic. Creating is an effect of the will. God gave you the will to create, just as God as the will to create. Magic is miscreation. Whatever you make alone is real to you but is not real to God.

2. The Last Judgement is one of the most threatening ideas in your thinking. 
²The Last Judgement is threatening is because you do not understand the Last Judgement. 
³Judgement is not an attribute of God. 
⁴Judgement was brought into being only after the separation, when judgement became one of the many learning devices to be built into the overall plan. 
⁵Just as the separation occurred over millions of years, the Last Judgement will extend over a similarly long period, and perhaps an even longer one. 
⁶The Last Judgement’s length can, however, be greatly shortened by miracles, the device for shortening but not abolishing time. 
⁷If a sufficient number become truly miracle-minded, the process of shortening time by miracles can be virtually immeasurable. 
⁸It is essential, however, that you free yourself from fear quickly, because you must emerge from the conflict if you are to bring peace to other minds.

##### Simplified

God does not judge. Judgement is a learning device. The Last Judgement extends over time. You can shorten the process by miracles. Free yourself from fear and conflict to bring peace to other minds.

:::tip
(1–4) The One-mindedness of God or Christ cannot judge, and thus God’s only judgement is not a judgement at all. … God’s judgement is simply the fact of His total Love for His beloved Sons. … In His [Holy Spirit’s] judgement there is no need to punish, simply to correct. Thus, the Holy Spirit's form of judgement is simply a way to re-unify the seemingly separated Sobnship. This is the “learning device” that was built into the overall plan. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.240.)

(5) It is really not likely to happen overnight. If you just thiink about how our world is constituted, there is a tremendous amount of frear that underlies and motivates every single aspect of it. Every institution, every system of thought within this world is motivated by fear and guilt. You just cannot change that right now. I think the plan of the Atonement and the Course’s part in it is to change individuals’ minds much more quickly than would otherwise happen. (Wapnick, ATG, p.102–10³.)

4. The first step toward freedom involves a sorting out of the false from the true. 
²This is a process of separation in the constructive sense, and reflects the true meaning of the Apocalypse. 
³Everyone will ultimately look upon his own creations and choose to preserve only what is good, just as God Himself looked upon what He had created and knew that it was good. 
⁴At this point, the mind can begin to look with love on its own creations because of their worthiness. 
⁵At the same time the mind will inevitably disown its miscreations which, without belief, will no longer exist.

(7–11) When we forgive everything in this world, thereby forgiving ourselves, there will be no fear. The guilt that demands fear of God’s punishment would be gone: without its *cause* (guilt), the *effect* (fear) must disappear. And this undoing of our guilt and fear through forgiveness constitutes our role in the Atonement. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 247.)
