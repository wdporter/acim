1. Our emphasis is now on healing. 
²The miracle is the means, the Atonement is the principle, and healing is the result. 
³To speak of “a miracle of healing” is to combine two orders of reality inappropriately. 
⁴Healing is not a miracle. 
⁵The Atonement, or the final miracle, is a remedy and any type of healing is a result. 
⁶The kind of error to which Atonement is applied is irrelevant. 
⁷All healing is essentially the release from fear. 
⁸To undertake this you cannot be fearful yourself. 
⁹You do not understand healing because of your own fear.

<!-- ##### commentary :::tip
(³–4) And yet Chapter 27 speaks of “a miracle of healing” ([T-27.II.5:2](/text/27-the-healing-of-the-dream/ii-the-fear-of-healing#p5)). The apparent inconsistency is resloved by recognising that in the first reference [ie this paragraph] Jesus is emphasising that the miracle is a means, while healing is the result. This teaching purpose was not present later in the text, and so the more poetic expression, “a miracle of healing” could be used. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.609.)

2. A major step in the Atonement plan is to undo error at all levels. 
²Sickness or ‘not-right-mindedness’ is the result of level confusion, because it always entails the belief that what is amiss on one level can adversely affect another. 
³We have referred to miracles as the means of correcting level confusion, for all mistakes must be corrected at the level on which they occur. 
⁴Only the mind is capable of error. 
⁵The body can act wrongly only when it is responding to misthought. 
⁶The body cannot create, and the belief that it can, a fundamental error, produces all physical symptoms. 
⁷Physical illness represents a belief in magic. 
⁸The whole distortion that made magic rests on the belief that there is a creative ability in matter which the mind cannot control. 
⁹This error can take two forms: it can be believed that the mind can miscreate in the body, or that the body can miscreate in the mind. 
¹⁰When it is understood that the mind, the only level of creation, cannot create beyond itself, neither type of confusion need occur.

<!-- ##### commentary :::tip Sickness is no different from any other form in the world that reflects the ego’s purpose. … The physical world is nothing but the projection of the underlying thought of separation. Thus, the body merely carries out the wishes of the mind, having no power within itself. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.76.)

:::tip …the Son’s mistake of confusing the levels of the mind and body, and his believing that the body can cause pain, indeed, that the body can do anything at all. It is the belief that it can that Jesus equates with magic, the ego’s tactic to confuse the Son as to where the problem and solution truly are. … it is not only the body that does nothing, but the separated mind as well; it has not really created “beyond itself”, as the ego has claimed.

⁷This is not because the body is a miracle, but because it is not inherently open to misinterpretation. 
⁸The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world. 
⁹Its abilities can be and frequently are overevaluated. 
¹⁰However, it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world. 
¹¹Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial. 
¹²The term ‘unworthy’ here implies only that it is not necessary to protect the mind by denying the unmindful. 
¹³If one denies this unfortunate aspect of the mind’s power, one is also denying the power itself.

The ability to miscreate is part of the ability to create. 
The mind’s miscreations can used as learning devices. 
Do not deny the body. 
The body is a learning device you should use.

A sentence in the ur-text has been deleted from between 12 and 13. 
The sentence is essential to understanding 13. 
“There is little doubt that the mind can miscreate”. 
I.e. the body has been (mis)-created by the mind, but the ability to miscreate is an unfortunate side-effect of the mind having the ability to create. 
So don’t deny the body, but use the body as a learning device. —Ed.

<!-- :::tip (8–12) When we fall into this ego trap of denial we are forgetting that one cannot leave this world of illusion without *first* correcting these illuusions on the level where our belief is placed. The goal of *A Course in Miracles* is to transform the world not to transcend it, which is the step belonging to God when He lifts us back to Himself after all our misperceptions have been corrected by the Holy Spirit. While the Course places great emphasis on sA.V.I.ng time, time is *not* saved through denial , but through  undoing our guilt in our relationships where it is the most pwerfully projected. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 111.) :::
:::tip (8–12) Once deluded into believing the phenomenal world is real, one must inevitably make physical and/or psychological suffering real as well. However, because we believe our bodies are the locus of our experience, *A Course in Miracles* does not ask us to deny our bodiy experiences in this world, or the experiences of others. Such denial merely serves the ego by having made something terrible appear to be real and external to our minds, thereby protecting the thought of guilt that *is* the only problem. … [this] passage … highlights its gentle practicality, even within the context of an uncompromising non-dualism.

4. All material means that you accept as remedies for bodily ills are restatements of magic principles. 
²This is the first step in believing that the body makes its own illness. 
³It is a second misstep to attempt to heal it through non-creative agents. 
⁴It does not follow, however, that the use of such agents for corrective purposes is evil. 
⁵Sometimes the illness has a sufficiently strong hold over the mind to render a person temporarily inaccessible to the Atonement. 
⁶In this case it may be wise to utilise a compromise approach to mind and body, in which something from the outside is temporarily given healing belief. 
⁷This is because the last thing that can help the non-right-minded, or the sick, is an increase in fear. 
⁸They are already in a fear-weakened state. 
⁹If they are prematurely exposed to a miracle, they may be precipitated into panic.
