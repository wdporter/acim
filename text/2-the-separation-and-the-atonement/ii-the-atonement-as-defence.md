# T-2.II The Atonement as Defence

1.&emsp;You can do anything I ask. 
<sup>2</sup>I have asked you to perform miracles, and have made it clear that miracles are natural, corrective, healing and universal. 
<sup>3</sup>There is nothing they cannot do, but they cannot be performed in the spirit of doubt or fear. 
<sup>4</sup>When you are afraid of anything, you are acknowledging its power to hurt you. 
<sup>5</sup>Remember that where your heart is, there is your treasure also. 
<sup>6</sup>You believe in what you value. 
<sup>7</sup>If you are afraid, you are valuing wrongly. 
<sup>8</sup>Your understanding will then inevitably value wrongly, and by endowing all thoughts with equal power will inevitably destroy peace. 
<sup>9</sup>That is why the Bible speaks of “the peace of God which passes understanding”. 
<sup>10</sup>This peace is totally incapable of being shaken by errors of any kind. 
<sup>11</sup>It denies the ability of anything not of God to affect you. 
<sup>12</sup>This is the proper use of denial. 
<sup>13</sup>It is not used to hide anything, but to correct error. 
<sup>14</sup>It brings all error into the light, and since error and darkness are the same, it corrects error automatically.

#### commentary

:::tip
(11–2:5)… the two uses of denial: the ego’s need to deny the guilt it has first made real, as opposed to the Holy Spirit’s denial of the ego’s denial of truth. The Holy Spirit denies the reality of the ego’s story of sin, guilt and fear, and denies that the ego has indeed changed our reality as God’s Son. (Wapnick, AVI, p.84.)

2.&emsp;True denial is a powerful protective device. 
<sup>2</sup>You can and should deny any belief that error can hurt you. 
<sup>3</sup>This kind of denial is not a concealment but a correction. 
<sup>4</sup>Your right mind depends on it. 
<sup>5</sup>Denial of error is a strong defence of truth, but denial of truth results in miscreation, the projections of the ego. 
<sup>6</sup>In the service of the right mind the denial of error frees the mind, and re-establishes the freedom of the will. 
<sup>7</sup>When the will is really free it cannot miscreate, because it recognises only truth.

True denial denies error can hurt you. True denial is protection from error. In the right mind you create truly.

3.&emsp;You can defend truth as well as error. 
<sup>2</sup>The means are easier to understand after the value of the goal is firmly established. 
<sup>3</sup>It is a question of what it is <em>for</em>. 
<sup>4</sup>Everyone defends his treasure, and will do so automatically. 
<sup>5</sup>The real questions are, what do you treasure, and how much do you treasure it? 
<sup>6</sup>Once you have learned to consider these questions and to bring them into all your actions, you will have little difficulty in clarifying the means. 
<sup>7</sup>The means are available whenever you ask. 
<sup>8</sup>You can, however, save time if you do not protract this step unduly. 
<sup>9</sup>The correct focus will shorten it mmeasurably.

4.&emsp;The Atonement is the only defence that cannot be used destructively because it is not a device you made. 
<sup>2</sup>The Atonement <em>principle</em> was in effect long before the Atonement began. 
<sup>3</sup>The principle was love and the Atonement was an <em>act</em> of love. 
<sup>4</sup>Acts were not necessary before the separation, because belief in space and time did not exist. 
<sup>5</sup>It was only after the separation that the Atonement and the conditions necessary for its fulfillment were planned. 
<sup>6</sup>Then a defence so splendid was needed that it could not be misused, although it could be refused. 
<sup>7</sup>Refusal could not, however, turn it into a weapon of attack, which is the inherent characteristic of other defences. 
<sup>8</sup>The Atonement thus becomes the only defence that is not a two-edged sword. 
<sup>9</sup> It can only heal.

(2–5) …the separated world needed a concrete manifestation of this [Atonement] principle, for while the Atonement came into existence with the creation of the Holy Spirit ([T-5.I.5:2](/text/5-healing-and-wholeness/i-the-invitation-to-the-holy-spirit#p5)), some figure within the Son’s dream had to represent it for us. The life of Jesus was this “act of love”, for he was the “thought” within the separated mind that first remembered its relationship with God and Identity as Christ (along with the rest of the Sonship).

(1–3) We made space and time in the instant the ego seemed to occur, and at that same instant God “gave” the Holy Spirit as the Correction, the principle of the Atonement. … When we have finally learned this lesson the classroom disappears, as does the ego itself. (Wapnick, AVI, p.130–131.)

(4–8) Learning cannot exist in Heaven, where there is only perfection. Learning is required only in this world. … Once we have totally learned our lessons, all that remains in our minds is the pure experience of our oneness with Christ and with God. Until that time, however, learning is necessary to help us unlearn the ego’s thought system of differences. (Wapnick, AVI, p.131.)

:::tip
When the separation occurred … ever since we have walked … away from God. The further we went away from God, the deeper we got involved with the world and the problems of guilt and sin. When we ask the Holy Spiriit to help us, we reverse this process and begin to walk towards God. Several of the most interesting sections of the Course talk about time. These are very hard to understand because we are still stuck in it. At one point it says that time seems to go forwards, but it is really going backward to the point at which time began. This is when the separation occurred. (Wapnick, ATG, p.106–107.)
