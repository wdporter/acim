1.&emsp;To extend is a fundamental aspect of God which He gave to His Son. 
²In the creation, God extended Himself to His creations and imbued them with the same loving Will to create. 
³You have not only been fully created, but have also been created perfect. 
⁴There is no emptiness in you. 
⁵Because of your likeness to your Creator you are creative. 
⁶No child of God can lose this ability because it is inherent in what he is, but he can use it inappropriately by projecting. 
⁷The inappropriate use of extension, or projection, occurs when you believe that some emptiness or lack exists in you, and that you can fill it with your own ideas instead of truth. 
⁸This process involves the following steps:  
&emsp;⁹First, you believe that what God created can be changed by your own mind.  
&emsp;¹⁰Second, you believe that what is perfect can be rendered imperfect or lacking.  
&emsp;¹¹Third, you believe that you can distort the creations of God, including yourself.  
&emsp;¹²Fourth, you believe that you can create yourself, and that the direction of your own creation is up to you.

You are God’s Son.

You project because you believe you lack something.

<!--::: details Commentary
(7) In the Course, the words ‘extension’ and ‘projection’ reflect the identical dynamic — the proceeding outward  of what is within the mind. ‘Extension’ … is reserved for the ‘movement’ or ‘outflow’ of spirit, while ‘projection’ is almost always utilised for the ego. …we can speak of extension as being the ‘appropriate’ use of projection. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.447–448).

(7) The Course distinguishes between two types of ‘projection’: One is called ‘extension’, referring to extending the Love of God that is accepted within. The other is an “inappropriate use of extension, or projection, occurs when you believe that some emptiness or lack exists in you, and that you can fill emptiness or lack with your own ideas instead of truth”. The ego’s purpose is always to distort the present reality of a situation so as to project guilt or lack, and justify its attack. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.39.)

(7) …linking the two terms [projection and extension] to the same dynamic [the proceeding ‘outward’ of what is within the mind] … (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.8.)

(9–2:1) “You”, the ego tells the Son, “by refusing to accept as sufficient His gifts to you, have committed a sin against your Father and Creator. You”, the ego continues, “decided that perfection and everything as Christ was not enough, and that there had to be something more: ‘freedom’ to choose to be other than God”. It is this illusory exercise of choice in the name of ‘freedom’ that the ego terms sin. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.461.)

(9–2:1) In the dream we believed that we had the power to oppose and defeat God, usurping His authority, making up a body we call our self to inhabit a material world of duality and fragmentation. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.38.)

(9–2:1) …the entire ego thought system of betrayal and murder that begins with the insane thought that the reality of Christ must be sacrificed for the survival of the separated self. …this entire thought system is fabricated by the ego, wherein it substitutes its made-up version of the separated relationship between God and His Son for the truth of Their unity. Thus it achieves the goal of preserving its own existence. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p. ³5.)

2.&emsp;These related distortions represent a picture of what actually occurred in the separation, or the ‘detour into fear’. 
²None of this existed before the separation, nor does it actually exist now. 
³Everything God created is like Him. 
⁴Extension, as undertaken by God, is similar to the inner radiance that the children of the Father inherit from Him. 
⁵Its real source is internal. 
⁶This is as true of the Son as of the Father. 
⁷In this sense the creation includes both the creation of the Son by God, and the Son’s creations when his mind is healed. 
⁸This requires God’s endowment of the Son with free will, because all loving creation is freely given in one continuous line, in which all aspects are of the same order.

3.&emsp;The Garden of Eden, or the preseparation condition, was a state of mind in which nothing was needed. 
²When Adam listened to the ‘lies of the serpent’, all he heard was untruth. 
³You do not have to continue to believe what is not true unless you choose to do so. 
⁴All that can literally disappear in the twinkling of an eye because it is merely a misperception. 
⁵What is seen in dreams seems to be very real. 
⁶Yet the Bible says that a deep sleep fell upon Adam, and nowhere is there reference to his waking up. 
⁷The world has not yet experienced any comprehensive reäwakening or rebirth. 
⁸Such a rebirth is impossible as long as you continue to project or miscreate. 
⁹It still remains within you, however, to extend as God extended His Spirit to you. 
¹⁰In reality this is your only choice, because your free will was given you for your joy in creating the perfect.

³Here is the real basis for your escape from fear. 
⁴The escape is brought about by your acceptance of the Atonement, which enables you to realise that your errors never really occurred. 
⁵Only after the deep sleep fell upon Adam could he experience nightmares. 
⁶If a light is suddenly turned on while someone is dreaming a fearful dream, he may initially interpret the light itself as part of his dream and be afraid of it. 
⁷However, when he awakens, the light is correctly perceived as the release from the dream, which is then no longer accorded reality. 
⁸This release does not depend on illusions. 
⁹The knowledge that illuminates not only sets you free, but also shows you clearly that you *are* free.

<!-- ::: details Commentary
(para 3–4) The sin that we are most guilty of, which ultimately is the source of all our guilt, is the sin of our belief in a separation from God… This is roughly the same as what the Churches have taught as “original sin”. The description in the third chapter of Genesis gives a perfect account of how the ego was born. (Wapnick, A.T.G., p.39.)

(6–9) The world was comfortably asleep, dreaming its dream of separation, individuality and specialness. Suddenly, like a telephone ringing outside the dream, Jesus appeared. His very presence stated the following: this world of time and space is a dream that in truth is already over; it is possible to awaken from this dream by listening to my words and following my example; and the many gods you believe in are not true because the real God is One of total Oneness and Love. (Wapnick, A.A.C., p.209.)
