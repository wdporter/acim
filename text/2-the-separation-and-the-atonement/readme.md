1.&emsp;To extend is a fundamental aspect of God which He gave to His Son. 
<sup>2</sup>In the creation, God extended Himself to His creations and imbued them with the same loving Will to create. 
<sup>3</sup>You have not only been fully created, but have also been created perfect. 
<sup>4</sup>There is no emptiness in you. 
<sup>5</sup>Because of your likeness to your Creator you are creative. 
<sup>6</sup>No child of God can lose this ability because it is inherent in what he is, but he can use it inappropriately by projecting. 
<sup>7</sup>The inappropriate use of extension, or projection, occurs when you believe that some emptiness or lack exists in you, and that you can fill it with your own ideas instead of truth. 
<sup>8</sup>This process involves the following steps:<br>
&emsp;<sup>9</sup>First, you believe that what God created can be changed by your own mind.<br>
&emsp;<sup>10</sup>Second, you believe that what is perfect can be rendered imperfect or lacking.<br>
&emsp;<sup>11</sup>Third, you believe that you can distort the creations of God, including yourself.<br>
&emsp;<sup>12</sup>Fourth, you believe that you can create yourself, and that the direction of your own creation is up to you.

You are God’s Son. You are creative. You misuse creativity by projecting. You project because you believe you lack something. You believe you can create yourself.

#### commentary

:::tip
(7) In the Course, the words ‘extension’ and ‘projection’ reflect the identical dynamic — the proceeding outward  of what is within the mind. ‘Extension’… is reserved for the ‘movement’ or ‘outflow’ of spirit, while ‘projection’ is almost always utilised for the ego. …we can speak of extension as being the ‘appropriate’ use of projection. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.447–448).
:::

:::tip
(7) The Course distinguishes between two types of “projection”: One is called “extension”, referring to extending the Love of God that is accepted within. The other is an “inappropriate use of extension, or projection, occurs when you believe that some emptiness or lack exists in you, and that you can fill emptiness or lack with your own ideas instead of truth”. The ego’s purpose is always to distort the present reality of a situation so as to project guilt or lack, and justify its attack. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.39.)

:::tip
(7) …linking the two terms [projection and extension] to the same dynamic [the proceeding ‘outward’ of what is within the mind] … (Wapnick, AAC, p.8.)

:::tip
(9–2:1) “You”, the ego tells the Son, “by refusing to accept as sufficient His gifts to you, have committed a sin against your Father and Creator. You”, the ego continues, “decided that perfection and everything as Christ was not enough, and that there had to be something more: ‘freedom’ to choose to be other than God”. It is this illusory exercise of choice in the name of ‘freedom’ that the ego terms sin. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.461.)
:::

:::tip
(9–2:1) In the dream we believed that we had the power to oppose and defeat God, usurping His authority, making up a body we call our self to inhabit a material world of duality and fragmentation. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 38.)
:::

:::tip
(9–2:1) …the entire ego thought system of betrayal and murder that begins with the insane thought that the reality of Christ must be sacrificed for the survival of the separated self. …this entire thought system is fabricated by the ego, wherein it substitutes its made-up version of the separated relationship between God and His Son for the truth of Their unity. Thus it achieves the goal of preserving its own existence. (Wapnick, AAC, p. 35.)

<sup>2</sup>None of this existed before the separation, nor does it actually exist now. 
<sup>3</sup>Everything God created is like Him.

(para 3–4) The sin that we are most guilty of, which ultimately is the source of all our guilt, is the sin of our belief in a separation from God… This is roughly the same as what the Churches have taught as “original sin”. The description in the third chapter of Genesis gives a perfect account of how the ego was born. (Wapnick, ATG, p. 39.)

(6–9) The world was comfortably asleep, dreaming its dream of separation, individuality and specialness. Suddenly, like a telephone ringing outside the dream, Jesus appeared. His very presence stated the following: this world of time and space is a dream that in truth is already over; it is possible to awaken from this dream by listening to my words and following my example; and the many gods you believe in are not true because the real God is One of total Oneness and Love.

4.&emsp;The Atonement is the only defence that cannot be used destructively because it is not a device you made. 
<sup>2</sup>The Atonement <em>principle</em> was in effect long before the Atonement began. 
<sup>3</sup>The principle was love and the Atonement was an <em>act</em> of love. 
<sup>4</sup>Acts were not necessary before the separation, because belief in space and time did not exist. 
<sup>5</sup>It was only after the separation that the Atonement and the conditions necessary for its fulfillment were planned. 
<sup>6</sup>Then a defence so splendid was needed that it could not be misused, although it could be refused.

(2–5) …the separated world needed a concrete manifestation of this [Atonement] principle, for while the Atonement came into existence with the creation of the Holy Spirit ([T-5.I.5:2](/text/5-healing-and-wholeness/i-the-invitation-to-the-holy-spirit#p5)), some figure within the Son’s dream had to represent it for us. The life of Jesus was this “act of love”, for he was the “thought” within the separated mind that first remembered its relationship with God and Identity as Christ (along with the rest of the Sonship).

When the separation occurred … ever since we have walked … away from God. The further we went away from God, the deeper we got involved with the world and the problems of guilt and sin. When we ask the Holy Spiriit to help us, we reverse this process and begin to walk towards God. Several of the most interesting sections of the Course talk about time. These are very hard to understand because we are still stuck in it. At one point it says that time seems to go forwards, but it is really going backward to the point at which time began. This is when the separation occurred. (Wapnick, ATG, p.106–107.)

(11) God, of course, cannot weep or be lonely, but these references reflect both His love for us and the Holy Spirit’s desire that we return to our Father and be free from the pain of believing we are still separate from Him. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.215.) (see [T-5.VII.4:5]("text/5-healing-and-wholeness/vii-the-decision-for-god#p4))
:::	

:::tip
(11) Clearly, since God is abstract and does not have a body, He does not get lonely, nor weep; as He is the All, He cannot be incomplete. Further, the very idea that He could be any of these things clearly implies that the separation of His Son from Himself has actually happened, and this of course is directly antithetical to the Course’s teachings. The point that is being made, therefore, has to be understood on the level of the *content* of God’s love for His children (itself of course an anthropocentric metaphor), expressd through the *form* of an earthly father’s love for his child. Since we are still very much children in the spiritual life —  “You are very new in the ways of salvation” ([T-17.V.9:1](/text/17-forgiveness-and-the-holy-relationship/v-the-healed-relationship#p9)), *A Course in Miracles* tells us — the Course’s use of language at this level is more than appropriate.

(3–4) And yet Chapter 27 speaks of “a miracle of healing” ([T-27.II.5:2](/text/27-the-healing-of-the-dream/ii-the-fear-of-healing#p5)). The apparent inconsistency is resloved by recognising that in the first reference [ie this paragraph] Jesus is emphasising that the miracle is a means, while healing is the result. This teaching purpose was not present later in the text, and so the more poetic expression, “a miracle of healing” could be used. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.609.)

Sickness is no different from any other form in the world that reflects the ego’s purpose. … The physical world is nothing but the projection of the underlying thought of separation. Thus, the body merely carries out the wishes of the mind, having no power within itself. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.76.)

…the Son’s mistake of confusing the levels of the mind and body, and his believing that the body can cause pain, indeed, that the body can do anything at all. It is the belief that it can that Jesus equates with magic, the ego’s tactic to confuse the Son as to where the problem and solution truly are. … it is not only the body that does nothing, but the separated mind as well; it has not really created “beyond itself”, as the ego has claimed.

A sentence in the ur-text has been deleted from between 12 and 13. The sentence is essential to understanding 13. “There is little doubt that the mind can miscreate”. I.e. the body has been (mis)-created by the mind, but the ability to miscreate is an unfortunate side-effect of the mind having the ability to create. So don’t deny the body, but use the body as a learning device. —Ed.

Fear of release comes from believing the mind can hurt itself. The mind cannot hurt itself. The mind’s miscreations do not exist. The body is a learning device for the mind.

6.&emsp;It is possible to reach a state in which you bring your mind under my guidance without conscious effort, but bringing your mind under my guidance without conscious effort implies a willingness that you have not developed as yet.

<sup>3</sup>The strength to do comes from your undivided decision. 
<sup>4</sup>There is no strain in doing God’s Will as soon as you recognise that God’s Will is also your own will. 
<sup>5</sup>The lesson here is quite simple, but particularly apt to be overlooked. 
<sup>6</sup>I will therefore repeat the lesson, urging you to listen.

(14) …a helpful metaphor is the decision maker (observer) as the part of our minds that chooses to review the ego’s movie (wrong mind) or the Holy Spirit’s correction (right mind). Remember that the entire movie *including* the correction has already been filmed, and encompasses the world of evolution, spanning billions of years. Within this gigantic epic  is an *almost* infinite number of segments or video tapes, each corresponding to the epxression of a thought. (Wapnick, AVI, p.10.)

(1–6)What Jesus and the Holy Spirit *do* do, however, is teach us that we have made a mistake in our thinking, which has resulted in the problem of fear that we have now externalised. They have come to us to represent another way of thinking, that we may choose again. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.123.)

(4–5) One cannot undo fear by reducing or underestimating the power of the mind.

There is no fear. There is only love. You must first recognise that you believe in separation. Recognising the belief in separation is temporary. Then the belief in separation can be corrected.

6.&emsp;It should especially be noted that God has only <em>one</em> Son.

God has one Son. The Son has many parts. The Son is not whole without all the parts. A part of the Son can believe in error or incompleteness.

The conflict is between there being only one Son while the Son has many parts. It is an error to believe either a) we are part of the Sonship but somehow incomplete; or b) we are separate, or apart from, or not a part of, the Sonship (Ed.)

# T-2.VIII The Meaning of the Last Judgement

## T-2.VIII.1

1.&emsp;One of the ways in which you can correct the magic–miracle confusion is to remember that you did not create yourself. 
<sup>2</sup>You are apt to forget this when you become egocentric, and this puts you in a position where a belief in magic is virtually inevitable. 
<sup>3</sup>Your will to create was given you by your Creator, Who was expressing the same Will in His creation. 
<sup>4</sup>Since creative ability rests in the mind, everything you create is necessarily a matter of will. 
<sup>5</sup>It also follows that whatever you alone make is real in your own sight, though not in the Mind of God. 
<sup>6</sup>This basic distinction leads directly into the real meaning of the Last Judgement.

You did not create yourself. If you believe you did create yourself you will believe in magic. Creating is an effect of the will. God gave you the will to create, just as God as the will to create. Magic is miscreation. Whatever you make alone is real to you but is not real to God.
