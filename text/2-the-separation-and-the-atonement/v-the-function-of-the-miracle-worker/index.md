1. Before miracle workers are ready to undertake their function in this world, it is essential that they fully understand the fear of release. 
²Otherwise they may unwittingly foster the belief that release is imprisonment, a belief that is already very prevalent. 
³This misperception arises in turn from the belief that harm can be limited to the body. 
⁴That is because of the underlying fear that the mind can hurt itself. 
⁵None of these errors is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind do not really exist. 
⁶This recognition is a far better protective device than any form of level confusion, because it introduces correction at the level of the error. 
⁷It is essential to remember that only the mind can create, and that correction belongs at the thought level. 
⁸To amplify an earlier statement, spirit is already perfect and therefore does not require correction. 
⁹The body does not exist except as a learning device for the mind. 
¹⁰This learning device is not subject to errors of its own, because it cannot create. 
¹¹It is obvious, then, that inducing the mind to give up its miscreations is the only application of creative ability that is truly meaningful.

(3–11) … elaborates on … this theme of the inherent non-existence of the split mind and body. The acceptance of this truth *is* the acceptance of the Atonement, and is the basis of all healing. (Wapnick, A.A.C., 232.)

(3–11) Therefore the miracle would undo the heart of the ego’s strategy by undoing the Son’s level confusion of believing his problem was in the body, rather than in his mind’s decision to turn away from the truth of his Identity as spirit. (Wapnick, A.A.C., 233.) (c/f [para 5](#5), [para 15:1–2](#15)).

2. Magic is the mindless or the miscreative use of mind. 
²Physical medications are forms of ‘spells’, but if you are afraid to use the mind to heal, you should not attempt to do so. 
³The very fact that you are afraid makes your mind vulnerable to miscreation. 
⁴You are therefore likely to misunderstand any healing that might occur, and because egocentricity and fear usually occur together, you may be unable to accept the real Source of the healing. 
⁵Under these conditions, it is safer for you to rely temporarily on physical healing devices, because you cannot misperceive them as your own creations.

²This means you recognise that mind is the only creative level, and that its errors are healed by the Atonement. 
³Once you accept this, your mind can only heal. 
⁴By denying your mind any destructive potential and reïnstating its purely constructive powers, you place yourself in a position to undo the level confusion of others.

(1) Our lives are the classrooms in which we learn forgiveness as the Holy Spirit teaches it. The centrality of this lesson in our lives and, in fact, what is really our only lesson, is summarised in a basic theme from the Course: “The sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself”. (Wapnick, CP, p. 36.)

(1) On the deepest level we all share one function, the purpose that gives meaning to our lives and to our struggles to find this meaning. That is the function of forgiveness. Our lives are the classrooms in which we learn forgiveness as the Holy Spirit teaches it. The centrality of this lessoon in our lives and, in fact, what is really our only lesson, is summarised in a basic theme from the Course: “The sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself”. (Wapnick, CP, p.36).

(1) The presence of the Holy Spirit as the bridge to Heaven this reflects what the Course calls the Atonement principle: the separation never truly happened. Acceptance of this truth is presented to us in the Course as our sole responsibility in this world. (Wapnick, CP, p. 79.)

(1) Our one responsibility is in deciding it is His life we wish and not the ego’s, for the Holy Spirit can take away our guilt only when we have withdrawn our investment in it. This is why the Course states that *the sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself*, meaning to accept the unreality of our guilt through forgiveness. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.54.)

(1) The Holy Spirit’s gentle Voice speaks only of the love of Heaven that could never be shattered by the sin that would render the Son homeless. Our one responsibility then is to accept the truth about who we are. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p. 514.)

(1) He [Jesus] is telling us rather that we will no longer be concerned with things that are not truly problems, but rather will recognise what our true problems are. The Course’s purpose is to help us gradually to recognise that our only function is to heal our own minds, and only that is important. …Jesus is certainly not suggesting that we do this apart from the form and symbols of the world; his Course does not advocate removing ourselves from the world but rather that we shift how we perceive the world. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.207–208.)
 
(1) Our one responsibility then is to change our minds and accept the truth about who we are: the sinless Son of God. It is this shift that Jesus refers to in *A Course in Miracles* when he re-iterates our “sole responsibility”… (Wapnick, A.A.C., p. 205.)

7. Corrective learning always begins with the awakening of spirit, and the turning away from the belief in physical sight. 
²This often entails fear, because you are afraid of what your spiritual sight will show you. 
³I said before that the Holy Spirit cannot see error, and is capable only of looking beyond it to the defence of Atonement. 
⁴There is no doubt that this may produce discomfort, yet the discomfort is not the final outcome of the perception. 
⁵When the Holy Spirit is permitted to look upon the defilement of the altar, He also looks immediately toward the Atonement. 
⁶Nothing He perceives can induce fear. 
⁷Everything that results from spiritual awareness is merely channelised toward correction. 
⁸Discomfort is aroused only to bring the need for correction into awareness.
