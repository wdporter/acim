1. Being afraid seems to be involuntary; something beyond your own control. 
²Yet I have said already that only constructive acts should be involuntary. 
³My control can take over everything that does not matter, while my guidance can direct everything that does, if you so choose. 
⁴Fear cannot be controlled by me, but it can be self-controlled. 
⁵Fear prevents me from giving you my control. 
⁶The presence of fear shows that you have raised body thoughts to the level of the mind. 
⁷This removes them from my control, and makes you feel personally responsible for them. 
⁸This is an obvious confusion of levels.

<!-- ##### commentary :::tip (1) One cannot undo fear by reducing or underestimating the power of the mind. If the power of our mind which chose mistakenly is not honoured and respected, then we are denying that very mind the power to correct itself through the Holy Spirit. We would have successfully denied the only means for our salvation — our power of decision — its efficacy to save us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.2³8.) see [T-2.VI.4:1–4](#p4), [T-2.VII.1:4–5](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vii-the-meaning-of-the-last-judgement#p1).

:::tip (³) The gap between our separated selves — the ego and our true self — is too great, remaining forever before our firghtened eyes as the constant reminder of our sin. Jesus becomes this bridge, and in making a distinction between control and guidance, he states in the Course that we should allow him to take *control* over everything that does not matter in our lives, turning our fears, anxieties and concerns over to him so that they may be removed from us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 298.) :::
:::tip (³) Jesus discusses our need to turn over to him all that does not matter, placing our egos under his control, so that he may then guide us in what does matter. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.129.) :::

Jesus [is] addressing the traditional view of his “doing it for us” … Jesus thus can help us in making another choice, but he cannot make that choice for us.

²When you ask for release from fear, you are implying that it is not. 
³You should ask, instead, for help in the conditions that have brought the fear about.

5. Fear is always a sign of strain, arising whenever what you want conflicts with what you do. 
²This situation arises in two ways: First, you can choose to do conflicting things, either simultaneously or successively. 
³This produces conflicted behaviour, which is intolerable to you because the part of the mind that wants to do something else is outraged. 
⁴Second, you can behave as you think you should, but without entirely wanting to do so. 
⁵This produces consistent behaviour, but entails great strain. 
⁶In both cases, the mind and the behaviour are out of accord, resulting in a situation in which you are doing what you do not wholly want to do. 
⁷This arouses a sense of coërcion that usually produces rage, and projection is likely to follow. 
⁸Whenever there is fear, it is because you have not made up your mind. 
⁹Your mind is therefore split, and your behaviour inevitably becomes erratic. 
¹⁰Correcting at the behavioural level can shift the error from the first to the second type, but will not obliterate the fear.

(14) …it means that the thoughts of [for example] shooting your wife, of putting the revolver down, or of doing something else entirely, have already happened. Thus you are not really having a new thought, but merely accessing different thoughts in your mind. Therefore, you are re-experiencing a thought that you once had. This is a mind-boggling idea, but it is the key to understanding what *A Course in Miracles* says about time. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.19.)

²I have already indicated that you cannot ask me to release you from fear. 
³I know it does not exist, but you do not. 
⁴If I intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a basic law of cause and effect; the most fundamental law there is. 
⁵I would hardly help you if I depreciated the power of your own thinking. 
⁶This would be in direct opposition to the purpose of this course. 
⁷It is much more helpful to remind you that you do not guard your thoughts carefully enough. 
⁸You may feel that at this point it would take a miracle to enable you to do this, which is perfectly true. 
⁹You are not used to miracle-minded thinking, but you can be trained to think that way.

:::tip
(1–6)What Jesus and the Holy Spirit *do* do, however, is teach us that we have made a mistake in our thinking, which has resulted in the problem of fear that we have now externalised. They have come to us to represent another way of thinking, that we may choose again. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.12³.)
:::

:::tip
(4–5) One cannot undo fear by reducing or underestimating the power of the mind. If the power of our mind which chose mistakenly is not honoured and respected, then we are denying that very mind the power to correct itself through the Holy Spirit. We would have successfully denied the only means for our salvation — our power of decision — its efficacy to save us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.2³8.) see [T-2.VI.1:4](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vi-fear-and-conflict#p1), [T-2.VI.4:1–4](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vi-fear-and-conflict#p4).

(4–6) Jesus is exhorting his students to pay careful attention to their mind’s decision to be unhappy, and to correct that *cause*, rather than continually seeking his help in remedying the *effect*, which ultimately makes no sense at all. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 6.)

There is no fear. There is only love. You must first recognise that you believe in separation. Recognising the belief in separation is temporary. Then the belief in separation can be corrected. Separation is corrected by accepting the Atonement. Time is a learning device. Time is the gap that enables you to recognise the belief in separation before you accept the Atonement.

⁵It also follows that whatever you alone make is real in your own sight, though not in the Mind of God.

2. The Last Judgement is one of the most threatening ideas in your thinking. 
²The Last Judgement is threatening is because you do not understand the Last Judgement. 
³Judgement is not an attribute of God. 
⁴Judgement was brought into being only after the separation, when judgement became one of the many learning devices to be built into the overall plan. 
⁵Just as the separation occurred over millions of years, the Last Judgement will extend over a similarly long period, and perhaps an even longer one.

God does not judge. Judgement is a learning device. The Last Judgement extends over time. You can shorten the process by miracles. Free yourself from fear and conflict to bring peace to other minds.

:::tip
(1–4) The One-mindedness of God or Christ cannot judge, and thus God’s only judgement is not a judgement at all. … God’s judgement is simply the fact of His total Love for His beloved Sons. … In His [Holy Spirit’s] judgement there is no need to punish, simply to correct. Thus, the Holy Spirit's form of judgement is simply a way to re-unify the seemingly separated Sobnship. This is the “learning device” that was built into the overall plan. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.240.)

(5) It is really not likely to happen overnight. If you just thiink about how our world is constituted, there is a tremendous amount of frear that underlies and motivates every single aspect of it. Every institution, every system of thought within this world is motivated by fear and guilt. You just cannot change that right now. I think the plan of the Atonement and the Course’s part in it is to change individuals’ minds much more quickly than would otherwise happen. (Wapnick, ATG, p.102–10³.)

4. The first step toward freedom involves a sorting out of the false from the true. 
²This is a process of separation in the constructive sense, and reflects the true meaning of the Apocalypse. 
³Everyone will ultimately look upon his own creations and choose to preserve only what is good, just as God Himself looked upon what He had created and knew that it was good. 
⁴At this point, the mind can begin to look with love on its own creations because of their worthiness. 
⁵At the same time the mind will inevitably disown its miscreations which, without belief, will no longer exist.

(7–11) When we forgive everything in this world, thereby forgiving ourselves, there will be no fear. The guilt that demands fear of God’s punishment would be gone: without its *cause* (guilt), the *effect* (fear) must disappear. And this undoing of our guilt and fear through forgiveness constitutes our role in the Atonement. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 247.)
