1. Being afraid seems to be involuntary; something beyond your own control. 
²Yet I have said already that only constructive acts should be involuntary. 
³My control can take over everything that does not matter, while my guidance can direct everything that does, if you so choose. 
⁴Fear cannot be controlled by me, but it can be self-controlled. 
⁵Fear prevents me from giving you my control. 
⁶The presence of fear shows that you have raised body thoughts to the level of the mind. 
⁷This removes them from my control, and makes you feel personally responsible for them. 
⁸This is an obvious confusion of levels.

(1) One cannot undo fear by reducing or underestimating the power of the mind. If the power of our mind which chose mistakenly is not honoured and respected, then we are denying that very mind the power to correct itself through the Holy Spirit. We would have successfully denied the only means for our salvation — our power of decision — its efficacy to save us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.238.) see [T-2.VI.4:1–4](#4), [T-2.VII.1:4–5](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vii-the-meaning-of-the-last-judgement).
 
(3) The gap between our separated selves — the ego and our true self — is too great, remaining forever before our firghtened eyes as the constant reminder of our sin. Jesus becomes this bridge, and in making a distinction between control and guidance, he states in the Course that we should allow him to take *control* over everything that does not matter in our lives, turning our fears, anxieties and concerns over to him so that they may be removed from us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 298.) 

(3) Jesus discusses our need to turn over to him all that does not matter, placing our egos under his control, so that he may then guide us in what does matter. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.129.) 

(4–5) Salvation is basically accomplished by our own work, done in union with the Holy Spirit. Jesus [is] addressing the traditional view of his “doing it for us” … Jesus thus can help us in making another choice, but he cannot make that choice for us. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.507 and paraphrased A.A.C., p.173.) (see [para. 4:1–5](#4))

(1, 4, 6–7) …controlling one’s actions is not sufficient to achieve real peace. Controlling one’s behaviour, while often a step in the right direction as it can reflect a desire to change one’s mind, still does not change the thoughts of guilt, which merely become strengthened, through their denial. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.109–110.) 

(4, 6) Our basic problem is the decision to see ourselves separated from God and thus unloved by Him, not what the world would identify as problems. It is this decision that must be changed. The correction for this error must occur in the place where it was made: in our minds, not in the world. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.2³8.)

We would have successfully denied the only means for our salvation — our power of decision — its efficacy to save us.

(1–4) Jesus is not offering to help us solve our external problems, nor to remove the fears we experience in our everyday lives, but rather he is teaching us how to join with him in undoing the *causes* of our fear, which lie in the mind’s decision to be separate from him and therefore from God. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.5.)
 
(1–4) Through our “little willingness” to turn our wills over to his [Jesus’], we undo the decision to separate which was the original problem. He cannot accomplish this for us without our choosing to join him. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.185.)

(1–5) Salvation is basically accomplished by our own work, done in union with the Holy Spirit. Jesus [is] addressing the traditional view of his “doing it for us” … Jesus thus can help us in making another choice, but he cannot make that choice for us. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.507.) (see [para. 1:4–5](#))

(6) …the curriculum of *A Course in Miracles* is a lifelong one, helping its students to embark on a journey that requires great diligence and consistent application. … One of the important messages to be learned from the text is the respect we should accord our ego thought system, not because it is true, but because we believe in it. Thus we can also state that the process of learning the Course involves growing in the discernment of knowing to which voice we are listening. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.604.)

5. Fear is always a sign of strain, arising whenever what you want conflicts with what you do. 
²This situation arises in two ways: First, you can choose to do conflicting things, either simultaneously or successively. 
³This produces conflicted behaviour, which is intolerable to you because the part of the mind that wants to do something else is outraged. 
⁴Second, you can behave as you think you should, but without entirely wanting to do so. 
⁵This produces consistent behaviour, but entails great strain. 
⁶In both cases, the mind and the behaviour are out of accord, resulting in a situation in which you are doing what you do not wholly want to do. 
⁷This arouses a sense of coërcion that usually produces rage, and projection is likely to follow. 
⁸Whenever there is fear, it is because you have not made up your mind. 
⁹Your mind is therefore split, and your behaviour inevitably becomes erratic. 
¹⁰Correcting at the behavioural level can shift the error from the first to the second type, but will not obliterate the fear.

(14) …a helpful metaphor is the decision maker (observer) as the part of our minds that chooses to review the ego’s movie (wrong mind) or the Holy Spirit’s correction (right mind). Remember that the entire movie *including* the correction has already been filmed, and encompasses the world of evolution, spanning billions of years. Within this gigantic epic  is an *almost* infinite number of segments or video tapes, each corresponding to the epxression of a thought. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.10.)

(14) …it means that the thoughts of [for example] shooting your wife, of putting the revolver down, or of doing something else entirely, have already happened. Thus you are not really having a new thought, but merely accessing different thoughts in your mind. Therefore, you are re-experiencing a thought that you once had. This is a mind-boggling idea, but it is the key to understanding what *A Course in Miracles* says about time. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.19.)
