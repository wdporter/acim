1. The Atonement can only be accepted within you by releasing the inner light. 
²Since the separation, defences have been used almost entirely to defend *against* the Atonement, and thus maintain the separation. 
³This is generally seen as a need to protect the body. 
⁴The many body fantasies in which minds engage arise from the distorted belief that the body can be used as a means for attaining ‘atonement’. 
⁵Perceiving the body as a temple is only the first step in correcting this distortion, because it alters only part of it. 
⁶It *does* recognise that Atonement in physical terms is impossible. 
⁷The next step, however, is to realise that a temple is not a structure at all. 
⁸Its true holiness lies at the inner altar around which the structure is built. 
⁹The emphasis on beautiful structures is a sign of the fear of Atonement, and an unwillingness to reach the altar itself. 
¹⁰The real beauty of the temple cannot be seen with the physical eye. 
¹¹Spiritual sight, on the other hand, cannot see the structure at all because it is perfect vision. 
¹²It can, however, see the altar with perfect clarity.

You believe you need the body to attain Atonement. 
In separation, you defend the body against Atonement. 
You protect the body by making it into a temple. 
You must realise a temple is holy because of the altar inside. 
Spiritual sight will show you the true altar.

2. For perfect effectiveness the Atonement belongs at the centre of the inner altar, where it undoes the separation and restores the wholeness of the mind. 
²Before the separation the mind was invulnerable to fear, because fear did not exist. 
³Both the separation and the fear are miscreations that must be undone for the restoration of the temple, and for the opening of the altar to receive the Atonement. 
⁴This heals the separation by placing within you the one effective defence against all separation thoughts and making you perfectly invulnerable.

3. The acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time. 
²This may appear to contradict free will because of the inevitability of the final decision, but this is not so. 
³You can temporise and you are capable of enormous procrastination, but you cannot depart entirely from your Creator, Who set the limits on your ability to miscreate. 
⁴An imprisoned will engenders a situation which, in the extreme, becomes altogether intolerable. 
⁵Tolerance for pain may be high, but it is not without limit. 
⁶Eventually everyone begins to recognise, however dimly, that there *must* be a better way. 
⁷As this recognition becomes more firmly established, it becomes a turning point. 
⁸This ultimately reäwakens spiritual vision, simultaneously weakening the investment in physical sight. 
⁹The alternating investment in the two levels of perception is usually experienced as conflict, which can become very acute. 
¹⁰But the outcome is as certain as God.

⁵Because of the strength of its vision, it brings the mind into its service. 
⁶This reëstablishes the power of the mind and makes it increasingly unable to tolerate delay, realising that it only adds unnecessary pain. 
⁷As a result, the mind becomes increasingly sensitive to what it would once have regarded as very minor intrusions of discomfort.

<!--  #### commentary :::tip (1–4) The Atonement undoes guilt simply by moving past it to the guiltlessness underneath. …our forgiveness of each other is the means through which God reminds us that we are guiltless as His Children. This is the Holy Spirit’s plan of the Atonement: I acknowledge the guiltlessness of the Son of God in you, and this awareness, shared with you in my mind, teaches me that that guiltlessness is what I am as well. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 146.) ::: 
:::tip (7) This sensitivity [to our deepest self], however, can become a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows us to turn over to Jesus our ego temptations, but on the other, it causes us to react even to the slightest ego stirrings. What really happens is that things we would have never noticed before now stick out like sore thumbs, a situation where “the mind becomes increasingly sensitive to what the mind would once have regarded as very minor intrusions of discomfort”.

<!-- #### commentary :::tip (11) God, of course, cannot weep or be lonely, but these references reflect both His love for us and the Holy Spirit’s desire that we return to our Father and be free from the pain of believing we are still separate from Him. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.215.) (see [T-5.VII.4:5]("text/5-healing-and-wholeness/vii-the-decision-for-god#p4)) :::	
:::tip (11) Clearly, since God is abstract and does not have a body, He does not get lonely, nor weep; as He is the All, He cannot be incomplete. Further, the very idea that He could be any of these things clearly implies that the separation of His Son from Himself has actually happened, and this of course is directly antithetical to the Course’s teachings. The point that is being made, therefore, has to be understood on the level of the *content* of God’s love for His children (itself of course an anthropocentric metaphor), expressd through the *form* of an earthly father’s love for his child. Since we are still very much children in the spiritual life —  “You are very new in the ways of salvation” ([T-17.V.9:1](/text/17-forgiveness-and-the-holy-relationship/v-the-healed-relationship#p9)), *A Course in Miracles* tells us — the Course’s use of language at this level is more than appropriate.
