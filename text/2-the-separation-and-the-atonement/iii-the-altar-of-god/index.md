1. The Atonement can only be accepted within you by releasing the inner light. 
²Since the separation, defences have been used almost entirely to defend *against* the Atonement, and thus maintain the separation. 
³This is generally seen as a need to protect the body. 
⁴The many body fantasies in which minds engage arise from the distorted belief that the body can be used as a means for attaining ‘atonement’. 
⁵Perceiving the body as a temple is only the first step in correcting this distortion, because it alters only part of it. 
⁶It *does* recognise that Atonement in physical terms is impossible. 
⁷The next step, however, is to realise that a temple is not a structure at all. 
⁸Its true holiness lies at the inner altar around which the structure is built. 
⁹The emphasis on beautiful structures is a sign of the fear of Atonement, and an unwillingness to reach the altar itself. 
¹⁰The real beauty of the temple cannot be seen with the physical eye. 
¹¹Spiritual sight, on the other hand, cannot see the structure at all because it is perfect vision. 
¹²It can, however, see the altar with perfect clarity.

You believe you need the body to attain Atonement. 
In separation, you defend the body against Atonement. 
You protect the body by making it into a temple. 
You must realise a temple is holy because of the altar inside. 
Spiritual sight will show you the true altar.

2. For perfect effectiveness the Atonement belongs at the centre of the inner altar, where it undoes the separation and restores the wholeness of the mind. 
²Before the separation the mind was invulnerable to fear, because fear did not exist. 
³Both the separation and the fear are miscreations that must be undone for the restoration of the temple, and for the opening of the altar to receive the Atonement. 
⁴This heals the separation by placing within you the one effective defence against all separation thoughts and making you perfectly invulnerable.

3. The acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time. 
²This may appear to contradict free will because of the inevitability of the final decision, but this is not so. 
³You can temporise and you are capable of enormous procrastination, but you cannot depart entirely from your Creator, Who set the limits on your ability to miscreate. 
⁴An imprisoned will engenders a situation which, in the extreme, becomes altogether intolerable. 
⁵Tolerance for pain may be high, but it is not without limit. 
⁶Eventually everyone begins to recognise, however dimly, that there *must* be a better way. 
⁷As this recognition becomes more firmly established, it becomes a turning point. 
⁸This ultimately reäwakens spiritual vision, simultaneously weakening the investment in physical sight. 
⁹The alternating investment in the two levels of perception is usually experienced as conflict, which can become very acute. 
¹⁰But the outcome is as certain as God.

<!-- #### commentary :::tip (11) God, of course, cannot weep or be lonely, but these references reflect both His love for us and the Holy Spirit’s desire that we return to our Father and be free from the pain of believing we are still separate from Him. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.215.) (see [T-5.VII.4:5]("text/5-healing-and-wholeness/vii-the-decision-for-god#p4)) :::	
:::tip (11) Clearly, since God is abstract and does not have a body, He does not get lonely, nor weep; as He is the All, He cannot be incomplete. Further, the very idea that He could be any of these things clearly implies that the separation of His Son from Himself has actually happened, and this of course is directly antithetical to the Course’s teachings. The point that is being made, therefore, has to be understood on the level of the *content* of God’s love for His children (itself of course an anthropocentric metaphor), expressd through the *form* of an earthly father’s love for his child. Since we are still very much children in the spiritual life —  “You are very new in the ways of salvation” ([T-17.V.9:1](/text/17-forgiveness-and-the-holy-relationship/v-the-healed-relationship#p9)), *A Course in Miracles* tells us — the Course’s use of language at this level is more than appropriate.

(3–4) And yet Chapter 27 speaks of “a miracle of healing” ([T-27.II.5:2](/text/27-the-healing-of-the-dream/ii-the-fear-of-healing#p5)). The apparent inconsistency is resloved by recognising that in the first reference [ie this paragraph] Jesus is emphasising that the miracle is a means, while healing is the result. This teaching purpose was not present later in the text, and so the more poetic expression, “a miracle of healing” could be used. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.609.)

Sickness is no different from any other form in the world that reflects the ego’s purpose. … The physical world is nothing but the projection of the underlying thought of separation. Thus, the body merely carries out the wishes of the mind, hA.V.I.ng no power within itself. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.76.)

:::tip
…the Son’s mistake of confusing the levels of the mind and body, and his believing that the body can cause pain, indeed, that the body can do anything at all. It is the belief that it can that Jesus equates with magic, the ego’s tactic to confuse the Son as to where the problem and solution truly are. … it is not only the body that does nothing, but the separated mind as well; it has not really created “beyond itself”, as the ego has claimed.

⁵A learning device has no power in a learning-device’s self to introduce actual learning errors. 
⁶The body, if properly understood, shares the invulnerability of the Atonement to two-edged application. 
⁷The body shares with the Atonement invulnerability to two-edged application, is not because the body is a miracle, but because the body is not inherently open to misinterpretation. 
⁸The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world. 
⁹The body’s abilities can be and frequently are overevaluated. 
¹⁰However, it is almost impossible to deny the body’s existence in this world. 
¹¹Those who deny the body’s existence in the world are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial. 
¹²The term ‘unworthy’ here implies only that it is not necessary to protect the mind by denying the unmindful. 
¹³If one denies the unfortunate power of the mind to miscreate, one is also denying the mind’s power to create.

#### simplified

The ability to miscreate is part of the ability to create. The mind’s miscreations can used as learning devices. Do not deny the body. The body is a learning device you should use.

A sentence in the ur-text has been deleted from between 12 and 13. The sentence is essential to understanding 13. “There is little doubt that the mind can miscreate”. I.e. the body has been (mis)-created by the mind, but the ability to miscreate is an unfortunate side-effect of the mind hA.V.I.ng the ability to create. So don’t deny the body, but use the body as a learning device. —Ed.

(8–12) When we fall into this ego trap of denial we are forgetting that one cannot leave this world of illusion without *first* correcting these illuusions on the level where our belief is placed. The goal of *A Course in Miracles* is to transform the world not to transcend it, which is the step belonging to God when He lifts us back to Himself after all our misperceptions have been corrected by the Holy Spirit. While the Course places great emphasis on sA.V.I.ng time, time is *not* saved through denial , but through  undoing our guilt in our relationships where it is the most pwerfully projected.

Such denial merely serves the ego by hA.V.I.ng made something terrible appear to be real and external to our minds, thereby protecting the thought of guilt that *is* the only problem. … [this] passage … highlights its gentle practicality, even within the context of an uncompromising non-dualism.

²Otherwise they may unwittingly foster the belief that release is imprisonment, a belief that is already very prevalent. 
3This misperception arises in turn from the belief that harm can be limited to the body. 
⁴That is because of the underlying fear that the mind can hurt itself. 
⁵None of these errors is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind do not really exist. 
⁶This recognition is a far better protective device than any form of level confusion, because it introduces correction at the level of the error. 
⁷It is essential to remember that only the mind can create, and that correction belongs at the thought level. 
⁸To amplify an earlier statement, spirit is already perfect and therefore does not require correction. 
⁹The body does not exist except as a learning device for the mind. 
¹⁰This learning device is not subject to errors of its own, because it cannot create. 
¹¹It is obvious, then, that inducing the mind to give up its miscreations is the only application of creative ability that is truly meaningful.

The Course’s purpose is to help us gradually to recognise that our only function is to heal our own minds, and only that is important. …Jesus is certainly not suggesting that we do this apart from the form and symbols of the world; his Course does not advocate removing ourselves from the world but rather that we shift how we perceive the world. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.207–208.)

(1) Our one responsibility then is to change our minds and accept the truth about who we are: the sinless Son of God. It is this shift that Jesus refers to in *A Course in Miracles* when he re-iterates our “sole responsibility”… (Wapnick, A.A.C., p. 205.)

6. It should be emphasised again that the body does not learn any more than it creates. 
²As a learning device it merely follows the learner, but if it is falsely endowed with self-initiative, it becomes a serious obstruction to the very learning it should facilitate. 
3Only the mind is capable of illumination. 
⁴Spirit is already illuminated and the body in itself is too dense. 
⁵The mind, however, can bring its illumination to the body by recognising that it is not the learner, and is therefore unamenable to learning. 
⁶The body is, however, easily brought into alignment with a mind that has learned to look beyond it toward the light.

7. Corrective learning always begins with the awakening of spirit, and the turning away from the belief in physical sight. 
²This often entails fear, because you are afraid of what your spiritual sight will show you. 
3I said before that the Holy Spirit cannot see error, and is capable only of looking beyond it to the defence of Atonement. 
⁴There is no doubt that this may produce discomfort, yet the discomfort is not the final outcome of the perception. 
⁵When the Holy Spirit is permitted to look upon the defilement of the altar, He also looks immediately toward the Atonement. 
⁶Nothing He perceives can induce fear. 
⁷Everything that results from spiritual awareness is merely channelised toward correction. 
⁸Discomfort is aroused only to bring the need for correction into awareness.

Corrective learning begins with the awakening of spirit and turning away from belief in physical sight. You are afraid of what spiritual sight will show you. Holy Spirit does not see error. Looking beyond error produces at first discomfort. Discomfort tells you correction is needed. If Holy Spirit looks on error, Holy Spirit immediately sees Atonement. There is no fear in the Atonement. Atonement brings correction.

8. The fear of healing arises in the end from an unwillingness to accept unequivocally that healing is necessary. 
²What the physical eye sees is not corrective, nor can error be corrected by any device that can be seen physically. 
3As long as you believe in what your physical sight tells you, your attempts at correction will be misdirected. 
⁴The real vision is obscured, because you cannot endure to see your own defiled altar. 
⁵But since the altar has been defiled, your state becomes doubly dangerous unless it *is* perceived.

9. Healing is an ability that developed after the separation, before which it was unnecessary. 
²Like all aspects of the belief in space and time, it is temporary. 
3However, as long as time persists, healing is needed as a means of protection. 
⁴This is because healing rests on charity, and charity is a way of perceiving the perfection of another even if you cannot perceive it in yourself. 
⁵Most of the loftier concepts of which you are capable now are time-dependent. 
⁶Charity is really a weaker reflection of a much more powerful love-encompassment that is far beyond any form of charity you can conceive of as yet. 
⁷Charity is essential to right-mindedness in the limited sense in which it can now be attained.

The separation introduced the need for healing. The need for healing persists as long as belief in space–time persists. Charity is the healing you can do in a limited form of right-mindedness.

#### commentary

:::tip
(1) One cannot undo fear by reducing or underestimating the power of the mind. If the power of our mind which chose mistakenly is not honoured and respected, then we are denying that very mind the power to correct itself through the Holy Spirit. We would have successfully denied the only means for our salvation — our power of decision — its efficacy to save us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p.238.) see [T-2.VI.4:1–4](#p4), [T-2.VII.1:4–5](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vii-the-meaning-of-the-last-judgement#p1).
:::

:::tip
(3) The gap between our separated selves — the ego and our true self — is too great, remaining forever before our firghtened eyes as the constant reminder of our sin. Jesus becomes this bridge, and in making a distinction between control and guidance, he states in the Course that we should allow him to take *control* over everything that does not matter in our lives, turning our fears, anxieties and concerns over to him so that they may be removed from us. (Wapnick, F.A.J., p. 298.)
:::

:::tip
(3) Jesus discusses our need to turn over to him all that does not matter, placing our egos under his control, so that he may then guide us in what does matter. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.129.)
:::

:::tip
(4–5) Salvation is basically accomplished by our own work, done in union with the Holy Spirit. Jesus [is] addressing the traditional view of his “doing it for us” … Jesus thus can help us in making another choice, but he cannot make that choice for us. (Wapnick, L.D.N.C., p.507 and paraphrased A.A.C., p.173.) (see [para. 4:1–5](#p4))

We would have successfully denied the only means for our salvation — our power of decision — its efficacy to save us.

The Last Judgement is the restoration of right-mindedness to all the Sonship.

(1–2) God cannot be involved in the Last Judgement because it is a correction for an error which He does not even know about. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 241.)

(3–6) At this final awakening we stand at the threshold of Heaven and look back at all the things we thought had been real, the entire span of time and space. We realise at last that everything we have made is false, and all that remains is the truth as God created it. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.242.)

:::tip
(7–8) The individual process of learning right-minded judgements is what is referred to here. As this is learned and we accept the Atonemnt for ourselves, the vacillations between the ego and the Holy Spirit cease, so that our judgements are only those of the Holy Spirit.

4. The first step toward freedom involves a sorting out of the false from the true. 
²This is a process of separation in the constructive sense, and reflects the true meaning of the Apocalypse. 
3Everyone will ultimately look upon his own creations and choose to preserve only what is good, just as God Himself looked upon what He had created and knew that it was good. 
⁴At this point, the mind can begin to look with love on its own creations because of their worthiness. 
⁵At the same time the mind will inevitably disown its miscreations which, without belief, will no longer exist.

First sort out the false from the true. Sorting out the false from the true is constructive separation. Keep what is good. You can love what you made. Withdraw belief from your miscreations.

5. The term ‘Last Judgement’ is frightening not only because it has been projected onto God, but also because of the association of ‘last’ with death. 
²This is an outstanding example of upside-down perception. 
3If the meaning of the Last Judgement is objectively examined, it is quite apparent that it is really the doorway to life. 
⁴No one who lives in fear is really alive. 
⁵Your own last judgement cannot be directed toward yourself, because you are not your own creation. 
⁶You can, however, apply it meaningfully and at any time to everything you have made, and retain in your memory only what is creative and good. 
⁷This is what your right-mindedness cannot but dictate. 
⁸The purpose of time is solely to ‘give you time’ to achieve this judgement. 
⁹It is your own perfect judgement of your own perfect creations. 
¹⁰When everything you retain is loveable, there is no reason for fear to remain with you. 
¹¹This is your part in the Atonement.

(3) The Course’s understanding of the Last Judgement is that it is the instant when we make that final judgement separating out the illusions of the ego from the truth of God, and there thus remains nothing left to hinder our return home. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 244.) 
:::

:::tip
(4) Living in fear is tantamount to identifying with the ego thought system which is, of course, the denial of life. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.245.)
:::

:::tip
(5–6) We cannot forgive our guilt by ourselves, but through forgiving others with the Holy Spirit’s help, our own guilt is undone. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p.246.) 
:::

:::tip
(7–11) When we forgive everything in this world, thereby forgiving ourselves, there will be no fear. The guilt that demands fear of God’s punishment would be gone: without its *cause* (guilt), the *effect* (fear) must disappear. And this undoing of our guilt and fear through forgiveness constitutes our role in the Atonement. (Wapnick, A.V.I., p. 247.)
