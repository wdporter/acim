# T-2.V The Function of the Miracle Worker

## T-2.V.1

<p class=fip id=p1>
1.&emsp;Before miracle workers are ready to undertake their function in this world, it is essential that they fully understand the fear of release. 
<sup>2</sup>Otherwise they may unwittingly foster the belief that release is imprisonment, a belief that is already very prevalent. 
<sup>3</sup>This misperception arises in turn from the belief that harm can be limited to the body. 
<sup>4</sup>That is because of the underlying fear that the mind can hurt itself. 
<sup>5</sup>None of these errors is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind do not really exist. 
<sup>6</sup>This recognition is a far better protective device than any form of level confusion, because it introduces correction at the level of the error. 
<sup>7</sup>It is essential to remember that only the mind can create, and that correction belongs at the thought level. 
<sup>8</sup>To amplify an earlier statement, spirit is already perfect and therefore does not require correction. 
<sup>9</sup>The body does not exist except as a learning device for the mind. 
<sup>10</sup>This learning device is not subject to errors of its own, because it cannot create. 
<sup>11</sup>It is obvious, then, that inducing the mind to give up its miscreations is the only application of creative ability that is truly meaningful.

Fear of release comes from believing the mind can hurt itself. The mind cannot hurt itself. The mind’s miscreations do not exist. The body is a learning device for the mind.

(3–11) … elaborates on … this theme of the inherent non-existence of the split mind and body. The acceptance of this truth *is* the acceptance of the Atonement, and is the basis of all healing. (Wapnick, AAC, 232.)

(3–11) Therefore the miracle would undo the heart of the ego’s strategy by undoing the Son’s level confusion of believing his problem was in the body, rather than in his mind’s decision to turn away from the truth of his Identity as spirit. (Wapnick, AAC, 233.) (c/f [5](#p5), [15:1–2](#p15)).

<sup>2</sup>You are perfectly safe as long as you are completely unconcerned about your readiness, but maintain a consistent trust in mine. 
<sup>3</sup>If your miracle working inclinations are not functioning properly, it is always because fear has intruded on your right-mindedness and has turned it upside down. 
<sup>4</sup>All forms of not-right-mindedness are the result of refusal to accept the Atonement for yourself. 
<sup>5</sup>If you do accept it, you are in a position to recognise that those who need healing are simply those who have not realised that right-mindedness <em>is</em> healing.

Looking beyond error produces at first discomfort. Discomfort tells you correction is needed. If Holy Spirit looks on error, Holy Spirit immediately sees Atonement. There is no fear in the Atonement. Atonement brings correction.
