	<p class=simplified>You make yourself fearfully by not guarding your thoughts carefully enough. Fear does not exist. The purpose of A Course in Miracles is to train you to think in a miracle-minded way.

	<p class=commentary>(1–6)What Jesus and the Holy Spirit <em>do</em> do, however, is teach us that we have made a mistake in our thinking, which has resulted in the problem of fear that we have now externalised. They have come to us to represent another way of thinking, that we may choose again. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.123.)

	<p class=commentary>(4–5) One cannot undo fear by reducing or underestimating the power of the mind. If the power of our mind which chose mistakenly is not honoured and respected, then we are denying that very mind the power to correct itself through the Holy Spirit. We would have successfully denied the only means for our salvation — our power of decision — its efficacy to save us. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.238.) see <a href="/text/2/vi#p1">T-2.VI.1:4</a>, <a href="/text/2/vi#p4">T-2.VI.4:1–4</a>.</p>

	<p class=commentary>(4–6) Jesus is exhorting his students to pay careful attention to their mind’s decision to be unhappy, and to correct that <em>cause</em>, rather than continually seeking his help in remedying the <em>effect</em>, which ultimately makes no sense at all. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 6.)

		2.&emsp;I cannot let you leave your mind unguarded, or you will not be able to help me. 
		<sup>2</sup>Miracle working entails a full realisation of the power of thought in order to avoid miscreation. 
		<sup>3</sup>Otherwise a miracle will be necessary to set the mind itself straight, a circular process that would not foster the time collapse for which the miracle was intended. 
		<sup>4</sup>The miracle worker must have genuine respect for true cause and effect as a necessary condition for the miracle to occur.

		3.&emsp;Both miracles and fear come from thoughts. 
		<sup>2</sup>If you are not free to choose one, you would also not be free to choose the other. 
		<sup>3</sup>By choosing the miracle you <em>have</em> rejected fear, if only temporarily. 
		<sup>4</sup>You have been fearful of everyone and everything. 
		<sup>5</sup>You are afraid of God, of me and of yourself. 
		<sup>6</sup>You have misperceived or miscreated Us, and believe in what you have made. 
		<sup>7</sup>You would not have done this if you were not afraid of your own thoughts. 
		<sup>8</sup>The fearful <em>must</em> miscreate, because they misperceive creation. 
		<sup>9</sup>When you miscreate you are in pain. 
		<sup>10</sup>The cause and effect principle now becomes a real expediter, though only temporarily. 
		<sup>11</sup>Actually, ‘Cause’ is a term properly belonging to God, and His ‘Effect’ is His Son. 
		<sup>12</sup>This entails a set of Cause and Effect relationships totally different from those you introduce into miscreation. 
		<sup>13</sup>The fundamental conflict in this world, then, is between creation and miscreation. 
		<sup>14</sup>All fear is implicit in the second, and all love in the first. 
		<sup>15</sup>The conflict is therefore one between love and fear.

		4.&emsp;It has already been said that you believe you cannot control fear because you yourself made it, and your belief in it seems to render it out of your control. 
		<sup>2</sup>Yet any attempt to resolve the error through attempting the mastery of fear is useless. 
		<sup>3</sup>In fact, it asserts the power of fear by the very assumption that it need be mastered. 
		<sup>4</sup>The true resolution rests entirely on mastery through love. 
		<sup>5</sup>In the interim, however, the sense of conflict is inevitable, since you have placed yourself in a position where you believe in the power of what does not exist.

		5.&emsp;Nothing and everything cannot co-exist. 
		<sup>2</sup>To believe in one is to deny the other.

		<sup>4</sup>Whenever light enters darkness, the darkness is abolished. 
		<sup>5</sup>What you believe is true for you. 
		<sup>6</sup>In this sense the separation <em>has</em> occurred, and to deny it is merely to use denial inappropriately. 
		<sup>7</sup>However, to concentrate on error is only a further error. 
		<sup>8</sup>The initial corrective procedure is to recognise temporarily that there is a problem, but only as an indication that immediate correction is needed. 
		<sup>9</sup>This establishes a state of mind in which the Atonement can be accepted without delay. 
		<sup>10</sup>It should be emphasised, however, that ultimately no compromise is possible between everything and nothing. 
		<sup>11</sup>Time is essentially a device by which all compromise in this respect can be given up. 
		<sup>12</sup>It only seems to be abolished by degrees, because time itself involves intervals that do not exist. 
		<sup>13</sup>Miscreation made this necessary as a corrective device. 
		<sup>14</sup>The statement “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life” needs only one slight correction to be meaningful in this context: “He gave it <em>to</em> His only begotten Son”.

	<p class=simplified>There is no fear. There is only love. You must first recognise that you believe in separation. Recognising the belief in separation is temporary. Then the belief in separation can be corrected. Separation is corrected by accepting the Atonement. Time is a learning device. Time is the gap that enables you to recognise the belief in separation before you accept the Atonement. 

	<p class=commentary>(14) <em>A Course in Miracles</em> does not teach that the world, the flesh and the devil are to be avoided, indulged in or fought against. Rather, its central teaching is to forgive the world, loving it <em>for</em> its gift of forgiveness. … The world that God gave “to” us is the real world, which reflects the Holy Spirit’s purpose in helping us shift from the ego’s purpose for being here — hatred and separation — to the Holy Spirit’s of forgiveness and joining. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 583.)

	<p class=commentary>(14) … [the Course’s] central teaching is to forgive the world, being grateful for its capacity of being a classroom in which we can accept Jesus’s gift of forgiveness. (Wapnick, AAC, p. 300.)

	<p class=simplified>God has one Son. The Son has many parts. The Son is not whole without all the parts. A part of the Son can believe in error or incompleteness. Believing in error or incompleteness is believing in the existence of nothingness. The Atonement is the correction of the error of believing in the existence of nothing.

	<p class=commentary>The conflict is between there being only one Son while the Son has many parts. It is an error to believe either a) we are part of the Sonship but somehow incomplete; or b) we are separate, or apart from, or not a part of, the Sonship (Ed.)

	<p class=commentary>(1–3) Similarly, the Course talks about the Great Rays (not Ray), which are the extensions of the light of God, similar to the rays of light that emanate from the sun. … we may yet state that Christ consists of infinite Rays (Sons of God), all perfectly united and indivisible; however, we clearly are not speaking here of personal individuality as we experience it in the world. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 449.) (Wapnick’s qualification appears unwarranted, but is somewhat expanded on in AAC, pp. 9–10. —Ed.)

	<p class=commentary>(3) …one cannot appreciate the pure wholeness and oneness of Christ by simply adding up the billions and billions of fragments that the world thinks is the Son of God, as if the Sonship were like a huge pie, a quantifiable entity consisting of a certain amount of separated fragments. (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 67.)

	<p class=simplified>Be ready to accomplish. Being ready to accomplish means having potential for a change of mind. The desire for accomplishment can be misguided because of fear. Fear is resolved by love in time. I control time and space. 

	<p class=commentary>(8–9) …we do not have to be perfect, and need not have mastered something in order to be ready to perform it. …if we feel overwhelmed by this task and think it would take a tremendous amount of time to learn to forgive, Jesus steps in at that point to remind us that time and space are under his control and therefore the miracle has the power to shorten time. (Wapnick, AVI, p.204.)

	<p class=commentary>(9) …when we turn our minds over to him, his love can then direct us within the illusory world of time and space to learn our lessons of forgiveness through the miracle. (Wapnick, AVI, p.129.)

	<p class=commentary>(9) …time is not linear, space is not real, and that if we let him teach us his lesson we could learn very quickly. (Wapnick, AVI, p.152.)
