(1–9) …powerful section on the crucifixion, where Jesus sets the record straight, explaining what went wrong in terms of how people understood his crucifixion. He explains why that happened and how a whole system of thought evolved out of that mistake. Jesus’ discussion is not traditionally Christian, though its principles are Christian in the sense of how he originally meant them. (Wapnick, ATG, p. 30.)

:::tip
(5–9) Given the Jewish people’s understanding of God’s plan for salvation, it is not difficult to see how the Jewish followers of Jesus would have viewed his crucifixion and death. He became God’s Suffering Servant, and in his “suffering, victimised and dying body” the people saw their own salvation. The Jesus who truly lived in God’s guiltless present was perceived through the  guilt-ridden eyes of the past, and these eyes saw in him the fulfillment of Isaiah’s guilt-reinforcing plan of salvation. Thus were sacrifice, guilt and punishment enthroned upon God’s altar, and true forgiveness and atonement was wrapped within the blood-stained body they saw on the cross and then placed in a sepulchre, symbol of hatred and death.

(2–3) Christian theologians were unconsciously impelled to justify their need to punish others (the inevitable result of projected guilt) by turning a God of Love into one of fear and retribution (“inverting a whole frame of reference”), thereby having Him act out their own repressed need to attack others to preserve their indiuvidual self. (Wapnick, AAC, p.255.)

(2–4) The ego’s unconscious demand to project its guilt — shared by all of us — did not allow these otherwise reasonable men and women to recognise the illogic, not to mention insanity, of their position. We should never underestimate the power of denial with its need to keep the truth away from us. … The persecuting Christian institutions during their two-thousand year history merely reflected the same need to persecute that is found in each of us… (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 208–209.)

If we believe that Jesus suffered *because* of our sins — that he, an innocent man, was punished by God and died *because* we were bad — it would be impossible for us not to be even guiltier. We then would (always) project this guilt onto others, seeing them as responsible for the death we unconsciously believe we brought about. Nor could we help projecting onto Jesus, and even onto God, a judgement that would punish us for our sins. Thus, we are unable to learn that our sins are forgiven — the lesson Jesus came to teach us — and have learned instead that salvation is sacrifice. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 206.)

(3) It was this entrapment in an alien world that the Gnostics experienced in a particularly painful way, as we have seen. *A Course in Miracles* too expresses this alientation of our self from Self, though without the Gnostic belief in entrapment. Many passages in the Course, however, are reminiscent of the anguished cries of the Gnostics who found themselves to be “strangers in a strange land”. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.481.)

(3) …a vicious circle in which we feel caught without seeming escape, entrapped in an alien world that is nothing but the reflection of the mind’s experience of being alienated from God. In many places, Jesus expresses this alienation of our self from Self, the experience of being  “a stranger in a strange land”, to borrow the famous phrase from Exodus. (Wapnick, AAC, p.105.)

#### commentary

:::tip
When the “tiny mad idea” seemed to occur and the dream of separation began, it appeared as if the Son of God were able to accomplish, and had indeed accomplished the impossible: splitting off from his true Self, leaving him with a separated mind that had itself split in two parts: the wrong mind, ruled by the  ego; and the right mind, the home of the Holy Spirit. This split mind is goverened by the self-concept of a *decision maker* that represents the power of the Son of God to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit. (Wapnick, AAC, p.86.)

(7) There are several places in the course which speak of the separated parts of the Sonship as “aspects” ([T-13.VI.6:4](/text/13-the-guiltless-world/vi-finding-the-present#p6); [T-15.V.2:3](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2). At other times Jesus refers to them as “parts” (e.g., [T-2.VII.6:2–7](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vii-cause-and-effect#p6); [T-12.IV.6:8](/text/12-the-holy-spirits-curriculum/iv-seeking-and-finding#p6); [T-15.V.2:2](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2); [T-15.V.3:1](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p3). Both are objective or neutral words to describe the seemingly personal individuality of God’s Sonship. The aspects of reality that we can still see here are the face of Christ that we see in each other, the sparks of the light of Christ that reflect our inherrent innocence (Wapnick, AVI, p. 259.)

#### commentary

:::tip
(3–4) The basic process in the Course’s undoing of guilt is summarised in its emphasis … on bringing the illusions of the ego’s darkness to the light of the Holy Spirit’s truth. … This statement reflects the fact that the correction of the ego thought system that he brought to the world’s awareness occurred at the dualistic level of the error, not at the non-dualistic level of truth. Thus he did not bring the truth of Heaven down to the world magically to shine away the darkness of sin… (Wapnick, FCTL, p.39)

(6–11) the Jesus in *A Course in Miracles* is clearly different from the biblical character who bears his name for, among other things, he makes it very clear that he *will not*, because he *cannot*,remove our sins from us. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.39.)

(12–14) It is a common misperception among people who work with *A Course in Miracles*, or other spiritual paths for that matter, that simply because they consciously wish to practice spiritual principles that they have already done so. Lesson 185, “I want the peace of God”, begins with the line, “To say these words is nothing. But to mean these words is everything” ([W-pI.185.1:1–2](/workbook/185-i-want-the-peace-of-god#p1)). Similarly, people could believe they are choosing to hear the Call and answering It, but they are really not doing that at all. As I have said many other times, this is not an easy path. It is humbling for a student of *A Course in Miracles* to reread the statement from the manual for teachers: “Only very few can hear God’s Voice at all…” ([M-12.3:3](/manual/12-how-many-teachers-of-god-are-needed-to-save-the-world#p3)).

(1–9) …powerful section on the crucifixion, where Jesus sets the record straight, explaining what went wrong in terms of how people understood his crucifixion. He explains why that happened and how a whole system of thought evolved out of that mistake.

:::tip
(5–9) Given the Jewish people’s understanding of God’s plan for salvation, it is not difficult to see how the Jewish followers of Jesus would have viewed his crucifixion and death. He became God’s Suffering Servant, and in his “suffering, victimised and dying body” the people saw their own salvation. The Jesus who truly lived in God’s guiltless present was perceived through the  guilt-ridden eyes of the past, and these eyes saw in him the fulfillment of Isaiah’s guilt-reinforcing plan of salvation. Thus were sacrifice, guilt and punishment enthroned upon God’s altar, and true forgiveness and atonement was wrapped within the blood-stained body they saw on the cross and then placed in a sepulchre, symbol of hatred and death.

If we believe that Jesus suffered *because* of our sins — that he, an innocent man, was punished by God and died *because* we were bad — it would be impossible for us not to be even guiltier. We then would (always) project this guilt onto others, seeing them as responsible for the death we unconsciously believe we brought about. Nor could we help projecting onto Jesus, and even onto God, a judgement that would punish us for our sins. Thus, we are unable to learn that our sins are forgiven — the lesson Jesus came to teach us — and have learned instead that salvation is sacrifice. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 206.)

God created your mind in the likeness of God’s mind. You have used your mind to miscreate. You are afraid of God’s Will. You miscreate because you believe you are not free. Your mind has imprisoned itself. An imprisoned mind means the will can’t assert itself in accord with God’s will. Heaven is the Son’s mind in perfect accord with the God.

<sup>2</sup>Certainty is always of God.

<sup>4</sup>Until you first perceive someone as someone is you cannot know someone. 
<sup>5</sup>While you ask questions about someone you are clearly implying that you do not know God. 
<sup>6</sup>Certainty does not require action. 
<sup>7</sup>When you say you are acting on the basis of knowledge, you are really confusing knowledge with perception. 
<sup>8</sup>Knowledge provides the strength for creative thinking, but not for right doing.

Loving someone is perceiving them as they are. Perceiving someone as they are is right perception. From right perception comes right action. Right actions are miracles. Knowledge is timeless. Knowledge is certain. Knowledge makes right thinking.

(3) It was this entrapment in an alien world that the Gnostics experienced in a particularly painful way, as we have seen. *A Course in Miracles* too expresses this alientation of our self from Self, though without the Gnostic belief in entrapment. Many passages in the Course, however, are reminiscent of the anguished cries of the Gnostics who found themselves to be “strangers in a strange land”. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.481.)

#### commentary

:::tip
When the “tiny mad idea” seemed to occur and the dream of separation began, it appeared as if the Son of God were able to accomplish, and had indeed accomplished the impossible: splitting off from his true Self, leaving him with a separated mind that had itself split in two parts: the wrong mind, ruled by the  ego; and the right mind, the home of the Holy Spirit. This split mind is goverened by the self-concept of a *decision maker* that represents the power of the Son of God to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit. (Wapnick, AAC, p.86.)

(7) There are several places in the course which speak of the separated parts of the Sonship as “aspects” ([T-13.VI.6:4](/text/13-the-guiltless-world/vi-finding-the-present#p6); [T-15.V.2:3](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2). At other times Jesus refers to them as “parts” (e.g., [T-2.VII.6:2–7](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vii-cause-and-effect#p6); [T-12.IV.6:8](/text/12-the-holy-spirits-curriculum/iv-seeking-and-finding#p6); [T-15.V.2:2](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2); [T-15.V.3:1](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p3). Both are objective or neutral words to describe the seemingly personal individuality of God’s Sonship. The aspects of reality that we can still see here are the face of Christ that we see in each other, the sparks of the light of Christ that reflect our inherrent innocence (Wapnick, AVI, p. 259.)

#### commentary

:::tip
(3–4) The basic process in the Course’s undoing of guilt is summarised in its emphasis … on bringing the illusions of the ego’s darkness to the light of the Holy Spirit’s truth. … This statement reflects the fact that the correction of the ego thought system that he brought to the world’s awareness occurred at the dualistic level of the error, not at the non-dualistic level of truth. Thus he did not bring the truth of Heaven down to the world magically to shine away the darkness of sin… (Wapnick, FCTL, p.39)

(6–11) the Jesus in *A Course in Miracles* is clearly different from the biblical character who bears his name for, among other things, he makes it very clear that he *will not*, because he *cannot*,remove our sins from us. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.39.)

(12–14) It is a common misperception among people who work with *A Course in Miracles*, or other spiritual paths for that matter, that simply because they consciously wish to practice spiritual principles that they have already done so. Lesson 185, “I want the peace of God”, begins with the line, “To say these words is nothing. But to mean these words is everything” ([W-pI.185.1:1–2](/workbook/185-i-want-the-peace-of-god#p1)). Similarly, people could believe they are choosing to hear the Call and answering It, but they are really not doing that at all. As I have said many other times, this is not an easy path. It is humbling for a student of *A Course in Miracles* to reread the statement from the manual for teachers: “Only very few can hear God’s Voice at all…” ([M-12.3:3](/manual/12-how-many-teachers-of-god-are-needed-to-save-the-world#p3)).

Our only need, therefore, is to remember that we have no needs. …the miracle simply undoes our faulty belief system, which then inevitably leads to the memory of our one need — the Love of God.

(4) The decision to attack another is really the decision to hold onto our guilt through the dynamic of projection. Thus, it is not so much the judgement we shall receive from the outside that is the warning here, but the judgement we would make against ourselves by attacking another, reïnforcing our own guilt. This is always the ego’s hidden motive: to retain our guilt by projecting it onto others. Jesus’ words, as elsewhere, should not be taken as a threat of God’s punishment or vengeance, but rather as a caution on the threat of punishment and vengeance we incur upon ourselves, which reïnforces the belief in our own sinfulness. Of such is <em>not</em> the Kingdom of Heaven. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 175. c/f [T-25.VIII.13:3](/text/25-the-justice-of-god/viii-justice-returned-to-love#p13))

(1–3) …guiltlessness is in the Mind of the Father, it must be in our minds, too, beecause the Holy Spirit’s Love is the bridge that joins all our minds in one. Judging another or ourselves erases that innocence from our awareness, for judgement obviously means separation. Thus, our ego’s fear of the joining, marking the end of the thought of separation, leads us to choose judgement as the means of ‘protecting’ ourselves from the unifying Love of the Holy Spirit, reflected in this world by forgiveness. The great importance of giving up judgement as the prerequisite to peace is a major theme in the Course (Wapnick, AVI, p. 143.)

(2) The Course states that the basis of our difficulties is the authority problem, a psychological concept which is redefined in religious terms. In the Course’s view this problem rests on the belief that we, rather than God, created ourselves. This strange belief is illustrated by the current emphasis in psychology on the ‘self-concept’, which implies that it is up to us to define and change our own reality as we see fit. This might be regarded as a modern versio of the situation found in the book of Genesis, in which Adam and Eve decided that they would be ‘other’ than God and have a will that was separated from His. … And indeed, most of us continually re-affirm the belief that we are separate from our Creator every second of our lives.

(1–4) …everyone in this world struggles with authority figures, the projected images of our belief that God is seeking to dominate and control us, and to suffocate our very existence by His Will. “Who is the author of my existence?” is the fundamental question everyone’s life attempts to answer, and as a result all believe that others are competitors for the position as well. [We sometimes we think we have an authority problem with Wapnick –Ed.] It should be mentioned that although the need to assert one’s authority in defiance of God and all substitute authority figures is shared by everyone, it certainly does not mean that behaviourally people should meekly allow tyrants — political, religious, or supervisory: physicall or psychologically — to subject them to abuse. [Ok, we feel better now, –Ed.] However, it does mean that one should be aware of the *unconscious* need to feel victimised by abusive authorities — real or imagined — so as to feel justified in perceiving themselves unfairly treated.

(1) Crucial to the Course’s understanding of salvation is that it is not “the world, the flesh and the devil” from which one needs to be saved, for that is not the problem. Rather, the problem is the underlying thought system of separation — the way we think — that brought about the world, the flesh and the devil. It is this “way of thinking” that we may more properly call the devil, it being nothing more than our belief that it is possible to have a force that opposes God, and that can succeed.

(sections [VI](/text/3-the-innocent-perception/vi-judgement-and-the-authority-problem) and VII) Once we see through the filter of the past, we cannot see the light of Christ that shines in others. Rather, we shall see around them only a shoadow of the guilt which *we* have put there. We put it there because we have projected it from our minds as a magical atttempt to escape from the guilt of *our* past. An example of this is people who have unresolved problems with their fathers, and with authority figures in general, who then see any authority figure as if that person were their father. The ultimate origin of the authority problem of course is our belief in the separation from God, the only Authrority. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 170.)
