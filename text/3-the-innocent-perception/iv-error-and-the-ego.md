Before the separation, the mind was a creator. After the separation, the mind split. The split mind became conscious, and began to perceive. Consciousness is the ego. The ego is wrong-minded. The ego sees you as you wish to be. What you are is all you can really know.
	
#### commentary

:::tip
When the “tiny mad idea” seemed to occur and the dream of separation began, it appeared as if the Son of God were able to accomplish, and had indeed accomplished the impossible: splitting off from his true Self, leaving him with a separated mind that had itself split in two parts: the wrong mind, ruled by the  ego; and the right mind, the home of the Holy Spirit. This split mind is goverened by the self-concept of a *decision maker* that represents the power of the Son of God to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit. (Wapnick, AAC, p.86.)

3.&emsp;The ego is the questioning aspect of the post-separation self, which was made rather than created. 
<sup>2</sup>It is capable of asking questions but not of perceiving meaningful answers, because these would involve knowledge and cannot be perceived. 
<sup>3</sup>The mind is therefore confused, because only One-mindedness can be without confusion. 
<sup>4</sup>A separated or divided mind <em>must</em> be confused. 
<sup>5</sup>It is necessarily uncertain about what it is. 
<sup>6</sup>It has to be in conflict because it is out of accord with itself. 
<sup>7</sup>This makes its aspects strangers to each other, and this is the essence of the fear-prone condition, in which attack is always possible. 
<sup>8</sup>You have every reason to feel afraid as you perceive yourself. 
<sup>9</sup>This is why you cannot escape from fear until you realise that you did not and could not create yourself. 
<sup>10</sup>You can never make your misperceptions true, and your creation is beyond your own error. 
<sup>11</sup>That is why you must eventually choose to heal the separation.

:::tip
(7) There are several places in the course which speak of the separated parts of the Sonship as “aspects” ([T-13.VI.6:4](/text/13-the-guiltless-world/vi-finding-the-present#p6); [T-15.V.2:3](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2). At other times Jesus refers to them as “parts” (e.g., [T-2.VII.6:2–7](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vii-cause-and-effect#p6); [T-12.IV.6:8](/text/12-the-holy-spirits-curriculum/iv-seeking-and-finding#p6); [T-15.V.2:2](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2); [T-15.V.3:1](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p3). Both are objective or neutral words to describe the seemingly personal individuality of God’s Sonship. The aspects of reality that we can still see here are the face of Christ that we see in each other, the sparks of the light of Christ that reflect our inherrent innocence (Wapnick, AVI, p. 259.)

5.&emsp;Perception always involves some misuse of mind, because it brings the mind into areas of uncertainty. 
<sup>2</sup>The mind is very active. 
<sup>3</sup>When it chooses to be separated it chooses to perceive. 
<sup>4</sup>Until then it wills only to know. 
<sup>5</sup>Afterwards it can only choose ambiguously, and the only way out of ambiguity is clear perception. 
<sup>6</sup>The mind returns to its proper function only when it wills to know. 
<sup>7</sup>This places it in the service of spirit, where perception is changed. 
<sup>8</sup>The mind chooses to divide itself when it chooses to make its own levels. 
<sup>9</sup>But it could not entirely separate itself from spirit, because it is from spirit that it derives its whole power to make or create. 
<sup>10</sup>Even in miscreation the mind is affirming its Source, or it would merely cease to be. 
<sup>11</sup>This is impossible, because the mind belongs to spirit which God created and which is therefore eternal.

The mind wills to know. When the mind chooses to be separate, then the mind chooses to perceive. The mind returns to unity by a willingness to know. The mind can never be entirely separate. Creation is the mind’s nature. The separated mind miscreates, which is an attempt to create.

(1) …perception is a relative phenomenon. It does not reflect a constant or absolute picture of the world around us — the seeming facts of the material universe — but rather perception is an *interpretation* of the world in which we live, which becomes, in effect, an unreal world.

6.&emsp;The ability to perceive made the body possible, because you must perceive <em>something</em> and <em>with</em> something. 
<sup>2</sup>That is why perception involves an exchange or translation, which knowledge does not need. 
<sup>3</sup>The interpretative function of perception, a distorted form of creation, then permits you to interpret the body as yourself in an attempt to escape from the conflict you have induced. 
<sup>4</sup>Spirit, which knows, could not be reconciled with this loss of power, because it is incapable of darkness. 
<sup>5</sup>This makes spirit almost inaccessible to the mind and entirely inaccessible to the body.

<sup>7</sup>Truth will always overcome error in this way. 
<sup>8</sup>This cannot be an active process of correction because, as I have already emphasised, knowledge does not do anything. 
<sup>9</sup>It can be perceived as an attacker, but it cannot attack.

The body is the result of the ability to perceive. Perception involves interpretation. Perception is distorted creation. Perception allow you to identify yourself with the body. Spirit abolishes perception, as light abolishes darkness, as truth abolishes error. Knowledge can never disappear. Perception disappears in knowledge.

:::tip
(3–4) The basic process in the Course’s undoing of guilt is summarised in its emphasis … on bringing the illusions of the ego’s darkness to the light of the Holy Spirit’s truth. … This statement reflects the fact that the correction of the ego thought system that he brought to the world’s awareness occurred at the dualistic level of the error, not at the non-dualistic level of truth. Thus he did not bring the truth of Heaven down to the world magically to shine away the darkness of sin… (Wapnick, FCTL, p.39)

(6–11) the Jesus in *A Course in Miracles* is clearly different from the biblical character who bears his name for, among other things, he makes it very clear that he *will not*, because he *cannot*,remove our sins from us. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.39.)

(12–14) It is a common misperception among people who work with *A Course in Miracles*, or other spiritual paths for that matter, that simply because they consciously wish to practice spiritual principles that they have already done so. Lesson 185, “I want the peace of God”, begins with the line, “To say these words is nothing. But to mean these words is everything” ([W-pI.185.1:1–2](/workbook/185-i-want-the-peace-of-god#p1)). Similarly, people could believe they are choosing to hear the Call and answering It, but they are really not doing that at all. As I have said many other times, this is not an easy path. It is humbling for a student of *A Course in Miracles* to reread the statement from the manual for teachers: “Only very few can hear God’s Voice at all…” ([M-12.3:3](/manual/12-how-many-teachers-of-god-are-needed-to-save-the-world#p3)).
