1. I have said that the abilities you possess are only shadows of your real strength, and that perception, which is inherently judgemental, was introduced only after the separation. 
²No one has been sure of anything since. 
³I have also made it clear that the resurrection was the means for the return to knowledge, which was accomplished by the union of my will with the Father’s. 
⁴We can now establish a distinction that will clarify some of our subsequent statements.

Your abilities are shadows of your real strength. 
Perception is judgemental. 
Perception was introduced after the separation. 
Resurrection is the means for return to knowledge. 
Resurrection was accomplished by my will being united with the Father’s will.

2. Since the separation, the words ‘create’ and ‘make’ have become confused. 
²When you make something, you do so out of a specific sense of lack or need. 
³Anything made for a specific purpose has no true generalisability. 
⁴When you make something to fill a perceived lack, you are tacitly implying that you believe in separation. 
⁵The ego has invented many ingenious thought systems for this purpose. 
⁶None of them is creative. 
⁷Inventiveness is wasted effort even in its most ingenious form. 
⁸The highly specific nature of invention is not worthy of the abstract creativity of God’s creations.

In *A Course in Miracles*, “make” is reserved for the world of separation or its correction, while “create” refers only to the activity of spirit in Heaven (see, for example, [T-2.VIII.1](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/viii-the-meaning-of-the-last-judgement#1); [T-4.I.9:3](/text/4-the-illusions-of-the-ego/i-right-teaching-and-right-learning#9)).

3. Knowing, as we have already observed, does not lead to doing. 
²The confusion between your real creation and what you have made of yourself is so profound that it has become literaly impossible for you to know anything. 
³Knowledge is always stable, and it is quite evident that you are not. 
⁴Nevertheless, you are perfectly stable as God created you. 
⁵In this sense, when your behaviour is unstable, you are disagreeing with God’s idea of your creation. 
⁶You can do this if you choose, but you would hardly want to do it if you were in your right mind.

4. The fundamental question you continually ask yourself cannot properly be directed to yourself at all. 
²You keep asking what it is you are. 
³This implies that the answer is not only one you know, but is also one that is up to you to supply. 
⁴Yet you cannot perceive yourself correctly. 
⁵You have no image to be perceived. 
⁶The word ‘image’ is always perception-related, and not a part of knowledge. 
⁷Images are symbolic and stand for something else. 
⁸The idea of ‘changing your image’ recognises the power of perception, but also implies that there is nothing stable to know.

5. Knowing is not open to interpretation. 
²You may try to ‘interpret’ meaning, but this is always open to error because it refers to the *perception* of meaning. 
³Such incongruities are the result of attempts to regard yourself as separated and unseparated at the same time. 
⁴It is impossible to make so fundamental a confusion without increasing your overall confusion still further. 
⁵Your mind may have become very ingenious, but as always happens when method and content are separated, it is utilised in a futile attempt to escape from an inescapable impasse. 
⁶Ingenuity is totally divorced from knowledge, because knowledge does not require ingenuity. 
⁷Ingenious thinking is not the truth that shall set you free, but you are free of the need to engage in it when you are willing to let it go.

6. Prayer is a way of asking for something. 
²It is the medium of miracles. 
³But the only meaningful prayer is for forgiveness, because those who have been forgiven have everything. 
⁴Once forgiveness has been accepted, prayer in the usual sense becomes utterly meaningless. 
⁵The prayer for forgiveness is nothing more than a request that you may be able to recognise what you already have. 
⁶In electing perception instead of knowledge, you placed yourself in a position where you could resemble your Father only by perceiving miraculously. 
⁷You have lost the knowledge that you yourself are a miracle of God. 
⁸Creation is your Source and your only real function.

(1–5) In other words, one cannot pray for something that is not there. One can only legitimately pray to remmeber or to accept the truth that is already within… We pray for help to forgive (undo) the illusion that there was ever anything but the perfect unity of God and Christ. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 547.)

(3, 5) If I believe I have a need, then ovbiously I have to do something about it; the idea behind the miracle (or healing) is that nothing has to be done. This of course does not mean that our bodies do not do things in this world, but simply that we recognise that it is the Holy Spirit’s Love that is “doing” it through us. Our only need, therefore, is to remember that we have no needs. …the miracle simply undoes our faulty belief system, which then inevitably leads to the memory of our one need — the Love of God. (Wapnick, AVI, p.81.) 

(5) What we “already have” reflects the principle of abundance: God has given us everything in our creation. This abundance has no referent to anything in the material world. Abundance is only of God, and cannot be expressed in what is not in Him. Thus, there can be no connection between the worlds of spirit and materiality, as they reflect mutually exclusive levels: one real, the other illusory. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.122.) 

(5) Our prayer, the, should be only for help in accepting the truth that is *already* there, …prayer is no different from forgiveness or the miracle, for they all reflect the process of undoing the ego thought system that never was, leaving to be itself the Love of God that has alway been. (Wapnick, AAC, p.259.)

7. The statement “God created man in his own image and likeness” needs reïnterpretation. 
²‘Image’ can be understood as ‘thought’, and ‘likeness’ as ‘of a like quality’. 
³God did create spirit in His Own Thought and of a quality like to His Own. 
⁴There is nothing else. 
⁵Perception, on the other hand, is impossible without a belief in ‘more’ and ‘less’. 
⁶At every level it involves selectivity. 
⁷Perception is a continual process of accepting and rejecting, organising and reörganising, shifting and changing. 
⁸Evaluation is an essential part of perception, because judgements are necessary in order to select.

Perception is an interpretation, not a fact. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.499; AAC, p.152.)

(7–8) Crucial to *A Course in Miracles* understanding of salvation is that it is not the world or sin from which one needs to be saved, for …the external is *not* the problem. (Wapnick, AAC, p.153.) 

(7) …perception is a relative phenomenon. It does not reflect a constant or absolute picture of the world around us — the seeming facts of the material universe — but rather perception is an *interpretation* of the world in which we live, which becomes, in effect, an unreal world.

²Perception becomes impossible.

⁵Only perception involves partial awareness. 
⁶Knowledge transcends the laws governing perception, because partial knowledge is impossible.
