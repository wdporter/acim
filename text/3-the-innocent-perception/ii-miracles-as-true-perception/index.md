1. I have stated that the basic concepts referred to in this course are not matters of degree. 
²Certain fundamental concepts cannot be understood in terms of opposites. 
³It is impossible to conceive of light and darkness or everything and nothing as joint possibilities. 
⁴They are all true or all false. 
⁵It is essential that you realise your thinking will be erratic until a firm commitment to one or the other is made. 
⁶A firm commitment to darkness or nothingness, however, is impossible. 
⁷No one has ever lived who has not experienced *some* light and *some* thing. 
⁸No one, therefore, is able to deny truth totally, even if he thinks he can.

Some concepts are either all true or all false. 
Example are light or darkness, or everything or nothing. 
You need to make a firm commitment. 
Everyone knows there is some *light* and some *thing*, so commit to those.

2. Innocence is not a partial attribute. 
²It is not real *until* it is total. 
³The partly innocent are apt to be quite foolish at times. 
⁴It is not until their innocence becomes a viewpoint with universal application that it becomes wisdom. 
⁵Innocent or true perception means that you never misperceive and always see truly. 
⁶More simply, it means that you never see what does not exist, and always see what does.

3. When you lack confidence in what someone will do, you are attesting to your belief that he is not in his right mind. 
²This is hardly a miracle-based frame of reference. 
³It also has the disastrous effect of denying the power of the miracle. 
⁴The miracle perceives everything as it is. 
⁵If nothing but the truth exists, right-minded seeing cannot see anything but perfection. 
⁶I have said that only what God creates or what you create with the same Will has any real existence. 
⁷This, then, is all the innocent can see. 
⁸They do not suffer from distorted perception.

4. You are afraid of God’s Will because you have used your own mind, which He created in the likeness of His Own, to miscreate. 
²The mind can miscreate only when it believes it is not free. 
³An ‘imprisoned’ mind is not free because it is possessed, or held back, by itself. 
⁴It is therefore limited, and the will is not free to assert itself. 
⁵To be one is to be of one mind or will. 
⁶When the Will of the Sonship and the Father are One, their perfect accord is Heaven.

God created your mind in the likeness of God’s mind. 
You have used your mind to miscreate. 
You are afraid of God’s Will. 
You miscreate because you believe you are not free. 
Your mind has imprisoned itself. 
An imprisoned mind means the will can’t assert itself in accord with God’s will. 
Heaven is the Son’s mind in perfect accord with the God.  

That is, oneness does not mean a numerical oneness of identity, but means being of one mind and will. (–Ed.)

5. Nothing can prevail against a Son of God who commends his spirit into the Hands of his Father. 
²By doing this the mind awakens from its sleep and remembers its Creator. 
³All sense of separation disappears. 
⁴The Son of God is part of the Holy Trinity, but the Trinity Itself is One. 
⁵There is no confusion within Its Levels, because They are of one Mind and one Will. 
⁶This single purpose creates perfect integration and establishes the peace of God. 
⁷Yet this vision can be perceived only by the truly innocent. 
⁸Because their hearts are pure, the innocent defend true perception instead of defending themselves against it. 
⁹Understanding the lesson of the Atonement they are without the wish to attack, and therefore they see truly.

6. The way to correct distortions is to withdraw your faith in them and invest it only in what is true. 
²You cannot make untruth true. 
³If you are willing to accept what is true in everything you perceive, you let it be true for you. 
⁴Truth overcomes all error, and those who live in error and emptiness can never find lasting solace. 
⁵If you perceive truly you are cancelling out misperceptions in yourself and in others simultaneously. 
⁶Because you see them as they are, you offer them your acceptance of their truth so they can accept it for themselves.

# T-3.III Perception versus Knowledge

## T-3.III.1

<p class=fip id=p1>
1. We have been emphasising perception, and have said very little about knowledge as yet. 
²This is because perception must be straightened out before you can know anything. 
³To know is to be certain. 
⁴Uncertainty means that you do not know. 
⁵Knowledge is power because it is certain, and certainty is strength. 
⁶Perception is temporary. 
⁷As an attribute of the belief in space and time, it is subject to either fear or love. 
⁸Misperceptions produce fear and true perceptions foster love, but neither brings certainty because all perception varies. 
⁹That is why it is not knowledge. 
¹⁰True perception is the basis for knowledge, but knowing is the affirmation of truth and beyond all perceptions.

2. All your difficulties stem from the fact that you do not recognise yourself, your brother or God. 
²To recognise means to “know again”, implying that you knew before. 
³You can see in many ways because perception involves interpretation, and this means that it is not whole or consistent. 
⁴The miracle, being a way of perceiving, is not knowledge. 
⁵It is the right answer to a question, but you do not question when you know. 
⁶Questioning illusions is the first step in undoing them. 
⁷The miracle, or the right answer, corrects them. 
⁸Since perceptions change, their dependence on time is obvious. 
⁹How you perceive at any given time determines what you do, and actions must occur in time. 
¹⁰Knowledge is timeless, because certainty is not questionable. 
¹¹You know when you have ceased to ask questions.

<p class=fip id=p3>
3. The questioning mind perceives itself in time, and therefore looks for future answers. 
²The closed mind believes the future and the present will be the same. 
³This establishes a seemingly stable state that is usually an attempt to counteract an underlying fear that the future will be worse than the present. 
⁴This fear inhibits the tendency to question at all.

Fear is believing the future will be worse than the present. Believing present and future will be the same is an attempt to counteract fear. Believing these will stop you from questioning illusions.

4. True vision is the natural perception of spiritual sight, but it is still a correction rather than a fact. 
²Spiritual sight is symbolic, and therefore not a device for knowing. 
³It is, however, a means of right perception, which brings it into the proper domain of the miracle. 
⁴A “vision of God” would be a miracle rather than a revelation. 
⁵The fact that perception is involved at all removes the experience from the realm of knowledge. 
⁶That is why visions, however holy, do not last.

(2) [these] passage well illustrate Jesus’ clear awareness of the use of symbols in *A Course of Miracles* as *reflections* of the truth, since the non-dualistic nature of truth cannot be expressed directly from one to the another (also [T-3.I.8:2](/text/3-the-innocent-perception/i-atonement-without-sacrifice#p8), [T-14.X.1:2–4,6–7; 2:1–2,4](/text/14-the-teaching-for-truth/x-the-equality-of-miracles#p1).

²Certainty is always of God. 
³When you love someone you have perceived him as he is, and this makes it possible for you to know him. 
⁴Until you first perceive him as he is you cannot know him.

⁸Knowledge provides the strength for creative thinking, but not for right doing. 
⁹Perception, miracles and doing are closely related. 
¹⁰Knowledge is the result of revelation and induces only thought. 
¹¹Even in its most spiritualised form perception involves the body. 
¹²Knowledge comes from the altar within and is timeless because it is certain.

(3) It was this entrapment in an alien world that the Gnostics experienced in a particularly painful way, as we have seen. *A Course in Miracles* too expresses this alientation of our self from Self, though without the Gnostic belief in entrapment. Many passages in the Course, however, are reminiscent of the anguished cries of the Gnostics who found themselves to be “strangers in a strange land”. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.481.)

(3) …a vicious circle in which we feel caught without seeming escape, entrapped in an alien world that is nothing but the reflection of the mind’s experience of being alienated from God. In many places, Jesus expresses this alienation of our self from Self, the experience of being  “a stranger in a strange land”, to borrow the famous phrase from Exodus. (Wapnick, AAC, p.105.)

Before the separation, the mind was a creator. After the separation, the mind split. The split mind became conscious, and began to perceive. Consciousness is the ego. The ego is wrong-minded. The ego sees you as you wish to be. What you are is all you can really know.

:::tip
When the “tiny mad idea” seemed to occur and the dream of separation began, it appeared as if the Son of God were able to accomplish, and had indeed accomplished the impossible: splitting off from his true Self, leaving him with a separated mind that had itself split in two parts: the wrong mind, ruled by the  ego; and the right mind, the home of the Holy Spirit. This split mind is goverened by the self-concept of a *decision maker* that represents the power of the Son of God to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit. (Wapnick, AAC, p.86.)

(7) There are several places in the course which speak of the separated parts of the Sonship as “aspects” ([T-13.VI.6:4](/text/13-the-guiltless-world/vi-finding-the-present#p6); [T-15.V.2:3](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2). At other times Jesus refers to them as “parts” (e.g., [T-2.VII.6:2–7](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vii-cause-and-effect#p6); [T-12.IV.6:8](/text/12-the-holy-spirits-curriculum/iv-seeking-and-finding#p6); [T-15.V.2:2](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2); [T-15.V.3:1](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p3). Both are objective or neutral words to describe the seemingly personal individuality of God’s Sonship. The aspects of reality that we can still see here are the face of Christ that we see in each other, the sparks of the light of Christ that reflect our inherrent innocence (Wapnick, AVI, p. 259.)

(3–4) The basic process in the Course’s undoing of guilt is summarised in its emphasis … on bringing the illusions of the ego’s darkness to the light of the Holy Spirit’s truth. … This statement reflects the fact that the correction of the ego thought system that he brought to the world’s awareness occurred at the dualistic level of the error, not at the non-dualistic level of truth. Thus he did not bring the truth of Heaven down to the world magically to shine away the darkness of sin… (Wapnick, FCTL, p.39)

(12–14) It is a common misperception among people who work with *A Course in Miracles*, or other spiritual paths for that matter, that simply because they consciously wish to practice spiritual principles that they have already done so. Lesson 185, “I want the peace of God”, begins with the line, “To say these words is nothing. But to mean these words is everything” ([W-pI.185.1:1–2](/workbook/185-i-want-the-peace-of-god#p1)). Similarly, people could believe they are choosing to hear the Call and answering It, but they are really not doing that at all. As I have said many other times, this is not an easy path. It is humbling for a student of *A Course in Miracles* to reread the statement from the manual for teachers: “Only very few can hear God’s Voice at all…” ([M-12.3:3](/manual/12-how-many-teachers-of-god-are-needed-to-save-the-world#p3)).

(1–9) …powerful section on the crucifixion, where Jesus sets the record straight, explaining what went wrong in terms of how people understood his crucifixion. He explains why that happened and how a whole system of thought evolved out of that mistake. Jesus’ discussion is not traditionally Christian, though its principles are Christian in the sense of how he originally meant them. (Wapnick, ATG, p. ³0.)

(5–9) Given the Jewish people’s understanding of God’s plan for salvation, it is not difficult to see how the Jewish followers of Jesus would have viewed his crucifixion and death. He became God’s Suffering Servant, and in his “suffering, victimised and dying body” the people saw their own salvation. The Jesus who truly lived in God’s guiltless present was perceived through the  guilt-ridden eyes of the past, and these eyes saw in him the fulfillment of Isaiah’s guilt-reinforcing plan of salvation. Thus were sacrifice, guilt and punishment enthroned upon God’s altar, and true forgiveness and atonement was wrapped within the blood-stained body they saw on the cross and then placed in a sepulchre, symbol of hatred and death.

If we believe that Jesus suffered *because* of our sins — that he, an innocent man, was punished by God and died *because* we were bad — it would be impossible for us not to be even guiltier. We then would (always) project this guilt onto others, seeing them as responsible for the death we unconsciously believe we brought about. Nor could we help projecting onto Jesus, and even onto God, a judgement that would punish us for our sins. Thus, we are unable to learn that our sins are forgiven — the lesson Jesus came to teach us — and have learned instead that salvation is sacrifice. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 206.)

⁸Misperceptions produce fear and true perceptions foster love, but neither brings certainty because all perception varies. 
⁹That is why it is not knowledge. 
¹⁰True perception is the basis for knowledge, but knowing is the affirmation of truth and beyond all perceptions.

(3) It was this entrapment in an alien world that the Gnostics experienced in a particularly painful way, as we have seen. *A Course in Miracles* too expresses this alientation of our self from Self, though without the Gnostic belief in entrapment. Many passages in the Course, however, are reminiscent of the anguished cries of the Gnostics who found themselves to be “strangers in a strange land”. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.481.)

(3) …a vicious circle in which we feel caught without seeming escape, entrapped in an alien world that is nothing but the reflection of the mind’s experience of being alienated from God. In many places, Jesus expresses this alienation of our self from Self, the experience of being  “a stranger in a strange land”, to borrow the famous phrase from Exodus. (Wapnick, AAC, p.105.)

Before the separation, the mind was a creator. After the separation, the mind split. The split mind became conscious, and began to perceive. Consciousness is the ego. The ego is wrong-minded. The ego sees you as you wish to be. What you are is all you can really know.

:::tip
When the “tiny mad idea” seemed to occur and the dream of separation began, it appeared as if the Son of God were able to accomplish, and had indeed accomplished the impossible: splitting off from his true Self, leaving him with a separated mind that had itself split in two parts: the wrong mind, ruled by the  ego; and the right mind, the home of the Holy Spirit. This split mind is goverened by the self-concept of a *decision maker* that represents the power of the Son of God to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit. (Wapnick, AAC, p.86.)

(7) There are several places in the course which speak of the separated parts of the Sonship as “aspects” ([T-13.VI.6:4](/text/13-the-guiltless-world/vi-finding-the-present#p6); [T-15.V.2:3](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2). At other times Jesus refers to them as “parts” (e.g., [T-2.VII.6:2–7](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/vii-cause-and-effect#p6); [T-12.IV.6:8](/text/12-the-holy-spirits-curriculum/iv-seeking-and-finding#p6); [T-15.V.2:2](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p2); [T-15.V.3:1](/text/15-the-holy-instant/v-the-holy-instant-and-special-relationships#p3). Both are objective or neutral words to describe the seemingly personal individuality of God’s Sonship. The aspects of reality that we can still see here are the face of Christ that we see in each other, the sparks of the light of Christ that reflect our inherrent innocence (Wapnick, AVI, p. 259.)

The mind wills to know. When the mind chooses to be separate, then the mind chooses to perceive. The mind returns to unity by a willingness to know. The mind can never be entirely separate. Creation is the mind’s nature. The separated mind miscreates, which is an attempt to create.

(3–4) The basic process in the Course’s undoing of guilt is summarised in its emphasis … on bringing the illusions of the ego’s darkness to the light of the Holy Spirit’s truth. … This statement reflects the fact that the correction of the ego thought system that he brought to the world’s awareness occurred at the dualistic level of the error, not at the non-dualistic level of truth. Thus he did not bring the truth of Heaven down to the world magically to shine away the darkness of sin… (Wapnick, FCTL, p.39)

(12–14) It is a common misperception among people who work with *A Course in Miracles*, or other spiritual paths for that matter, that simply because they consciously wish to practice spiritual principles that they have already done so. Lesson 185, “I want the peace of God”, begins with the line, “To say these words is nothing. But to mean these words is everything” ([W-pI.185.1:1–2](/workbook/185-i-want-the-peace-of-god#p1)). Similarly, people could believe they are choosing to hear the Call and answering It, but they are really not doing that at all. As I have said many other times, this is not an easy path. It is humbling for a student of *A Course in Miracles* to reread the statement from the manual for teachers: “Only very few can hear God’s Voice at all…” ([M-12.3:3](/manual/12-how-many-teachers-of-god-are-needed-to-save-the-world#p3)).

⁵The ego has invented many ingenious thought systems for this purpose.

(3, 5) If I believe I have a need, then ovbiously I have to do something about it; the idea behind the miracle (or healing) is that nothing has to be done. This of course does not mean that our bodies do not do things in this world, but simply that we recognise that it is the Holy Spirit’s Love that is “doing” it through us. Our only need, therefore, is to remember that we have no needs. …the miracle simply undoes our faulty belief system, which then inevitably leads to the memory of our one need — the Love of God.

(4) The decision to attack another is really the decision to hold onto our guilt through the dynamic of projection. Thus, it is not so much the judgement we shall receive from the outside that is the warning here, but the judgement we would make against ourselves by attacking another, reïnforcing our own guilt. This is always the ego’s hidden motive: to retain our guilt by projecting it onto others. Jesus’ words, as elsewhere, should not be taken as a threat of God’s punishment or vengeance, but rather as a caution on the threat of punishment and vengeance we incur upon ourselves, which reïnforces the belief in our own sinfulness. Of such is <em>not</em> the Kingdom of Heaven. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 175. c/f [T-25.VIII.13:3](/text/25-the-justice-of-god/viii-justice-returned-to-love#p13))

2. The choice to judge rather than to know is the cause of the loss of peace. 
²Judgement is the process on which perception but not knowledge rests. 
³I have discussed this before in terms of the selectivity of perception, pointing out that evaluation is its obvious prerequisite. 
⁴Judegment always involves rejection. 
⁵It never emphasises only the positive aspects of what is judged, whether in you or in others. 
⁶What has been perceived and rejected, or judged and found wanting, remains in your mind because it has been perceived. 
⁷One of the illusions from which you suffer is the belief that what you judged against has no effect. 
⁸This cannot be true unless you also believe that what you judged against does not exist. 
⁹You evidently do not believe this, or you would not have judged against it. 
¹⁰In the end it does not matter whether your judgment is right or wrong. 
¹¹Either way you are placing your belief in the unreal. 
¹²This cannot be avoided in any type of judgement, because it implies the belief that reality is yours to select <em>from</em>.

(1–3) …guiltlessness is in the Mind of the Father, it must be in our minds, too, beecause the Holy Spirit’s Love is the bridge that joins all our minds in one. Judging another or ourselves erases that innocence from our awareness, for judgement obviously means separation. Thus, our ego’s fear of the joining, marking the end of the thought of separation, leads us to choose judgement as the means of ‘protecting’ ourselves from the unifying Love of the Holy Spirit, reflected in this world by forgiveness. The great importance of giving up judgement as the prerequisite to peace is a major theme in the Course (Wapnick, AVI, p. 143.)

(2) The Course states that the basis of our difficulties is the authority problem, a psychological concept which is redefined in religious terms. In the Course’s view this problem rests on the belief that we, rather than God, created ourselves. This strange belief is illustrated by the current emphasis in psychology on the ‘self-concept’, which implies that it is up to us to define and change our own reality as we see fit. This might be regarded as a modern versio of the situation found in the book of Genesis, in which Adam and Eve decided that they would be ‘other’ than God and have a will that was separated from His. … And indeed, most of us continually re-affirm the belief that we are separate from our Creator every second of our lives.

(1–4) …everyone in this world struggles with authority figures, the projected images of our belief that God is seeking to dominate and control us, and to suffocate our very existence by His Will. “Who is the author of my existence?” is the fundamental question everyone’s life attempts to answer, and as a result all believe that others are competitors for the position as well. [We sometimes we think we have an authority problem with Wapnick –Ed.] It should be mentioned that although the need to assert one’s authority in defiance of God and all substitute authority figures is shared by everyone, it certainly does not mean that behaviourally people should meekly allow tyrants — political, religious, or supervisory: physicall or psychologically — to subject them to abuse. [Ok, we feel better now, –Ed.] However, it does mean that one should be aware of the *unconscious* need to feel victimised by abusive authorities — real or imagined — so as to feel justified in perceiving themselves unfairly treated.

The foundation of your thought system is a false belief in separation. Your thought system is your life. Your true foundation is that God created you. This is your real beginning. Go back to your beginning. At the beginning your Self is in peace. Nothing has truly happened since the beginning. Do not be afraid about the destruction of your thought system, that is, your life.

(1–4) For ‘the devil’, we could read ‘the belief in separation’ (—Ed.)

(1) Crucial to the Course’s understanding of salvation is that it is not “the world, the flesh and the devil” from which one needs to be saved, for that is not the problem. Rather, the problem is the underlying thought system of separation — the way we think — that brought about the world, the flesh and the devil. It is this “way of thinking” that we may more properly call the devil, it being nothing more than our belief that it is possible to have a force that opposes God, and that can succeed. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 499–500.)

(1) Therefore, if the problem is belief in separation, the solution can *only* be union. Forgiveness thus refers to the process of joining with another person (in a holy relationship) who heretofore had been experienced as separate from us (in a special relationship). (Wapnick, AAC, p.153.)

(sections [VI](/text/3-the-innocent-perception/vi-judgement-and-the-authority-problem) and VII) Once we see through the filter of the past, we cannot see the light of Christ that shines in others. Rather, we shall see around them only a shoadow of the guilt which *we* have put there. We put it there because we have projected it from our minds as a magical atttempt to escape from the guilt of *our* past. An example of this is people who have unresolved problems with their fathers, and with authority figures in general, who then see any authority figure as if that person were their father. The ultimate origin of the authority problem of course is our belief in the separation from God, the only Authrority. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 170.)
