1. I have stated that the basic concepts referred to in this course are not matters of degree. 
²Certain fundamental concepts cannot be understood in terms of opposites. 
³It is impossible to conceive of light and darkness or everything and nothing as joint possibilities. 
⁴They are all true or all false. 
⁵It is essential that you realise your thinking will be erratic until a firm commitment to one or the other is made. 
⁶A firm commitment to darkness or nothingness, however, is impossible. 
⁷No one has ever lived who has not experienced *some* light and *some* thing. 
⁸No one, therefore, is able to deny truth totally, even if he thinks he can.

⁶A firm commitment to darkness or nothingness, however, is impossible. 
⁷No one has ever lived who has not experienced *some* light and *some* thing. 
⁸No one, therefore, is able to deny truth totally, even if he [the truth-denier] thinks he [the truth-denier] can.

Some concepts are either all true or all false. 
Example are light or darkness, or everything or nothing. 
You need to make a firm commitment. 
Everyone knows there is some *light* and some *thing*, so commit to those.

2. Innocence is not a partial attribute. 
²It is not real *until* it is total. 
³The partly innocent are apt to be quite foolish at times. 
⁴It is not until their innocence becomes a viewpoint with universal application that it becomes wisdom. 
⁵Innocent or true perception means that you never misperceive and always see truly. 
⁶More simply, it means that you never see what does not exist, and always see what does.

Innocence is wisdom, but only for those totally innocent. 
The totally innocent will always see truly. 
Innocent perception means seeing only what exists.

3. When you lack confidence in what someone will do, you are attesting to your belief that he is not in his right mind. 
²This is hardly a miracle-based frame of reference. 
³It also has the disastrous effect of denying the power of the miracle. 
⁴The miracle perceives everything as it is. 
⁵If nothing but the truth exists, right-minded seeing cannot see anything but perfection. 
⁶I have said that only what God creates or what you create with the same Will has any real existence. 
⁷This, then, is all the innocent can see. 
⁸They do not suffer from distorted perception.

Miracles won’t happen if you believe others are not in their right minds. 
Do not distort your perception. 
See others with your right mind. 
Right-minded seeing can only see God’s perfect reality.

4. You are afraid of God’s Will because you have used your own mind, which He created in the likeness of His Own, to miscreate. 
²The mind can miscreate only when it believes it is not free. 
³An ‘imprisoned’ mind is not free because it is possessed, or held back, by itself. 
⁴It is therefore limited, and the will is not free to assert itself. 
⁵To be one is to be of one mind or will. 
⁶When the Will of the Sonship and the Father are One, their perfect accord is Heaven.

God created your mind in the likeness of God’s mind. 
You have used your mind to miscreate. 
You are afraid of God’s Will. 
You miscreate because you believe you are not free. 
Your mind has imprisoned itself. 
An imprisoned mind means the will can’t assert itself in accord with God’s will. 
Heaven is the Son’s mind in perfect accord with the God.  

That is, oneness does not mean a numerical oneness of identity, but means being of one mind and will. (–Ed.)

5. Nothing can prevail against a Son of God who commends his spirit into the Hands of his Father. 
²By doing this the mind awakens from its sleep and remembers its Creator. 
³All sense of separation disappears. 
⁴The Son of God is part of the Holy Trinity, but the Trinity Itself is One. 
⁵There is no confusion within Its Levels, because They are of one Mind and one Will. 
⁶This single purpose creates perfect integration and establishes the peace of God. 
⁷Yet this vision can be perceived only by the truly innocent. 
⁸Because their hearts are pure, the innocent defend true perception instead of defending themselves against it. 
⁹Understanding the lesson of the Atonement they are without the wish to attack, and therefore they see truly. 
¹⁰This is what the Bible means when it says, “When he shall appear (or be perceived) we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is”.

6. The way to correct distortions is to withdraw your faith in them and invest it only in what is true. 
²You cannot make untruth true. 
³If you are willing to accept what is true in everything you perceive, you let it be true for you. 
⁴Truth overcomes all error, and those who live in error and emptiness can never find lasting solace. 
⁵If you perceive truly you are cancelling out misperceptions in yourself and in others simultaneously. 
⁶Because you see them as they are, you offer them your acceptance of their truth so they can accept it for themselves. 
⁷This is the healing that the miracle induces.
