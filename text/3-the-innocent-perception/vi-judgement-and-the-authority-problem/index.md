²After the Last Judgement there will be no more. 
³Judgement is symbolic because beyond perception there is no judgement. 
⁴When the Bible says “Judge not that ye be not judged”, it means that if you judge the reality of others you will be unable to avoid judging your own.

In perception we judge others and judge ourselves. After the Last Judgement there will be no more judgement.

(4) The decision to attack another is really the decision to hold onto our guilt through the dynamic of projection. Thus, it is not so much the judgement we shall receive from the outside that is the warning here, but the judgement we would make against ourselves by attacking another, reïnforcing our own guilt. This is always the ego’s hidden motive: to retain our guilt by projecting it onto others. Jesus’ words, as elsewhere, should not be taken as a threat of God’s punishment or vengeance, but rather as a caution on the threat of punishment and vengeance we incur upon ourselves, which reïnforces the belief in our own sinfulness. Of such is <em>not</em> the Kingdom of Heaven. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 175. c/f [T-25.VIII.13:3](/text/25-the-justice-of-god/viii-justice-returned-to-love#p13))

2. The choice to judge rather than to know is the cause of the loss of peace. 
²Judgement is the process on which perception but not knowledge rests. 
³I have discussed this before in terms of the selectivity of perception, pointing out that evaluation is its obvious prerequisite. 
⁴Judegment always involves rejection. 
⁵It never emphasises only the positive aspects of what is judged, whether in you or in others. 
⁶What has been perceived and rejected, or judged and found wanting, remains in your mind because it has been perceived. 
⁷One of the illusions from which you suffer is the belief that what you judged against has no effect. 
⁸This cannot be true unless you also believe that what you judged against does not exist. 
⁹You evidently do not believe this, or you would not have judged against it. 
¹⁰In the end it does not matter whether your judgment is right or wrong. 
¹¹Either way you are placing your belief in the unreal. 
¹²This cannot be avoided in any type of judgement, because it implies the belief that reality is yours to select <em>from</em>.

²When you recognise what you are and what your brothers are, you will realise that judging them in any way is without meaning. 
³In fact, their meaning is lost to you precisely <em>because</em> you are judging them. 
⁴All uncertainty comes from the belief that you are under the coercion of judgement. 
⁵You do not need judgement to organise your life, and you certainly do not need it to organise yourself. 
⁶In the presence of knowledge all judgement is automatically suspended, and this is the process that enables recognition to replace perception.

(1–3) …guiltlessness is in the Mind of the Father, it must be in our minds, too, beecause the Holy Spirit’s Love is the bridge that joins all our minds in one. Judging another or ourselves erases that innocence from our awareness, for judgement obviously means separation. Thus, our ego’s fear of the joining, marking the end of the thought of separation, leads us to choose judgement as the means of ‘protecting’ ourselves from the unifying Love of the Holy Spirit, reflected in this world by forgiveness. The great importance of giving up judgement as the prerequisite to peace is a major theme in the Course (Wapnick, AVI, p. 143.)

(2) The Course states that the basis of our difficulties is the authority problem, a psychological concept which is redefined in religious terms. In the Course’s view this problem rests on the belief that we, rather than God, created ourselves. This strange belief is illustrated by the current emphasis in psychology on the ‘self-concept’, which implies that it is up to us to define and change our own reality as we see fit. This might be regarded as a modern versio of the situation found in the book of Genesis, in which Adam and Eve decided that they would be ‘other’ than God and have a will that was separated from His. … And indeed, most of us continually re-affirm the belief that we are separate from our Creator every second of our lives.

²When you have an authority problem, it is always because you believe you are the author of yourself and project your delusion onto others. 
³You then perceive the situation as one in which others are literally fighting you for your authorship. 
⁴This is the fundamental error of all those who believe they have usurped the power of God. 
⁵This belief is very frightening to them, but hardly troubles God. 
⁶He is, however, eager to undo it, not to punish His children, but only because He knows that it makes them unhappy. 
⁷God’s creations are given their true Authorship, but you prefer to be anonymous when you choose to separate yourself from your Author. 
⁸Being uncertain of your true Authorship, you believe that your creation was anonymous. 
⁹This leaves you in a position where it sounds meaningful to believe that you created yourself.

(1–4) …everyone in this world struggles with authority figures, the projected images of our belief that God is seeking to dominate and control us, and to suffocate our very existence by His Will. “Who is the author of my existence?” is the fundamental question everyone’s life attempts to answer, and as a result all believe that others are competitors for the position as well. [We sometimes we think we have an authority problem with Wapnick –Ed.] It should be mentioned that although the need to assert one’s authority in defiance of God and all substitute authority figures is shared by everyone, it certainly does not mean that behaviourally people should meekly allow tyrants — political, religious, or supervisory: physicall or psychologically — to subject them to abuse. [Ok, we feel better now, –Ed.] However, it does mean that one should be aware of the *unconscious* need to feel victimised by abusive authorities — real or imagined — so as to feel justified in perceiving themselves unfairly treated.

A thought system can be based on creating (active willing) or making (doing). A thought system based on lies has power because it is made by you.

The foundation of your thought system is a false belief in separation. Your thought system is your life. Your true foundation is that God created you. This is your real beginning. Go back to your beginning. At the beginning your Self is in peace. Nothing has truly happened since the beginning. Do not be afraid about the destruction of your thought system, that is, your life.

(1) Crucial to the Course’s understanding of salvation is that it is not “the world, the flesh and the devil” from which one needs to be saved, for that is not the problem. Rather, the problem is the underlying thought system of separation — the way we think — that brought about the world, the flesh and the devil. It is this “way of thinking” that we may more properly call the devil, it being nothing more than our belief that it is possible to have a force that opposes God, and that can succeed. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 499–500.)

(1) Therefore, if the problem is belief in separation, the solution can *only* be union. Forgiveness thus refers to the process of joining with another person (in a holy relationship) who heretofore had been experienced as separate from us (in a special relationship). (Wapnick, AAC, p.153.)

(sections [VI](/text/3-the-innocent-perception/vi-judgement-and-the-authority-problem) and VII) Once we see through the filter of the past, we cannot see the light of Christ that shines in others. Rather, we shall see around them only a shoadow of the guilt which *we* have put there. We put it there because we have projected it from our minds as a magical atttempt to escape from the guilt of *our* past. An example of this is people who have unresolved problems with their fathers, and with authority figures in general, who then see any authority figure as if that person were their father. The ultimate origin of the authority problem of course is our belief in the separation from God, the only Authrority. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 170.)
