²The crucifixion did not establish the Atonement; the resurrection did. 
³Many sincere Christians have misunderstood this.
⁴No one who is free of the belief in scarcity could possibly make this mistake. 
⁵If the crucifixion is seen from an upside-down point of view, it does appear as if God permitted and even encouraged one of His Sons to suffer because he was good. 
⁶This particularly unfortunate interpretation, which arose out of projection, has led many people to be bitterly afraid of God. 
⁷Such anti-religious concepts enter into many religions. 
⁸Yet the real Christian should pause and ask, “How could this be?”. 
⁹Is it likely that God Himself would be capable of the kind of thinking which His Own words have clearly stated is unworthy of His Son?

(1–9) …powerful section on the crucifixion, where Jesus sets the record straight, explaining what went wrong in terms of how people understood his crucifixion. He explains why that happened and how a whole system of thought evolved out of that mistake. Jesus’ discussion is not traditionally Christian, though its principles are Christian in the sense of how he originally meant them. (Wapnick, ATG, p. 30.)

(5–9) Given the Jewish people’s understanding of God’s plan for salvation, it is not difficult to see how the Jewish followers of Jesus would have viewed his crucifixion and death. He became God’s Suffering Servant, and in his “suffering, victimised and dying body” the people saw their own salvation. The Jesus who truly lived in God’s guiltless present was perceived through the  guilt-ridden eyes of the past, and these eyes saw in him the fulfillment of Isaiah’s guilt-reinforcing plan of salvation. Thus were sacrifice, guilt and punishment enthroned upon God’s altar, and true forgiveness and atonement was wrapped within the blood-stained body they saw on the cross and then placed in a sepulchre, symbol of hatred and death. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 205. c/f [2:9–11](#2), [3:4–7](#3)

2. The best defence, as always, is not to attack another’s position, but rather to protect the truth. 
²It is unwise to accept any concept if you have to invert a whole frame of reference in order to justify it. 
³This procedure is painful in its minor applications and genuinely tragic on a wider scale. 
⁴Persecution frequently results in an attempt to ‘justify’ the terrible misperception that God Himself persecuted His Own Son on behalf of salvation. 
⁵The very words are meaningless. 
⁶It has been particularly difficult to overcome this because, although the error itself is no harder to correct than any other, many have been unwilling to give it up in view of its prominent value as a defence. 
⁷In milder forms a parent says, “This hurts me more than it hurts you”, and feels exonerated in beating a child. 
⁸Can you believe our Father really thinks this way? 
⁹It is so essential that all such thinking be dispelled that we must be sure that nothing of this kind remains in your mind.

(2–3) Christian theologians were unconsciously impelled to justify their need to punish others (the inevitable result of projected guilt) by turning a God of Love into one of fear and retribution (“inverting a whole frame of reference”), thereby having Him act out their own repressed need to attack others to preserve their indiuvidual self. (Wapnick, AAC, p.255.)

(2–4) The ego’s unconscious demand to project its guilt — shared by all of us — did not allow these otherwise reasonable men and women to recognise the illogic, not to mention insanity, of their position. We should never underestimate the power of denial with its need to keep the truth away from us. … The persecuting Christian institutions during their two-thousand year history merely reflected the same need to persecute that is found in each of us… (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 208–209.) 

(3) …we can also recognise love’s distortions in the contradictions foun din teh Bible itself, not to mention in the centuries of bloodshed committed in the name of God, venerated through His “Holy Word” which had to be affirmed lest He or His self-appointed (sic) leaders would wreak punishment on all non-believers. …these tragic errors (Wapnick, AAC, p. 250–251.)

(11) The purpose of refocusing our thinking can be especially tricky because the ego will subtly burrow into anything, like a fifth column… Thus, the ego takes a book such as *A Course on Miracles*, as egoless as any book could be, and it will still use it for ego purposes. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 178–179. Is the irony lost on him? –Ed. (and yes, the editor also has his own ego purposes…).) 

(11) …in light of … all students’ proclivity for projection of guilt onto God and him, Jesus made this very clear statement (Wapnick, FCTL, p. 179) (Wapnick includes himself in that, we presume. –Ed.)

If we believe that Jesus suffered *because* of our sins — that he, an innocent man, was punished by God and died *because* we were bad — it would be impossible for us not to be even guiltier. We then would (always) project this guilt onto others, seeing them as responsible for the death we unconsciously believe we brought about. Nor could we help projecting onto Jesus, and even onto God, a judgement that would punish us for our sins. Thus, we are unable to learn that our sins are forgiven — the lesson Jesus came to teach us — and have learned instead that salvation is sacrifice. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 206.) 

(2) …does not mean we should trust our brother’s ego; “frightened peple can be vicious”, Jesus reminds us, and we are certainly not asked to deny the sometimes vicious forms of people’s calls for help. However, we are asked, when in the presence of such expressions of fear, to look beyond them to the love of God that is truly being called for. (Wapnick, LDNC. p. 549, AAC, p.272.) 

…to have faith that even in the midst of the ego’s dark camouflage, the light of Christ remains undimmed. (Wapnick, LDNC. p.549.) 

(2) Following the Course’s principle that fear must lead to viciousness, the ego must quickly and viciously conterattack to ensure that the Son does not realise he made a mistake, change his mind, and choose the Holy Spirit. (Wapnick, AAC, p.34.)
