# T-3.V Beyond Perception

## T-3.V.1

<p class=fip id=p1>
1.&emsp;I have said that the abilities you possess are only shadows of your real strength, and that perception, which is inherently judgmental, was introduced only after the separation. 
<sup>2</sup>No one has been sure of anything since. 
<sup>3</sup>I have also made it clear that the resurrection was the means for the return to knowledge, which was accomplished by the union of my will with the Father’s. 
<sup>4</sup>We can now establish a distinction that will clarify some of our subsequent statements.

Recap: perception was introduced after the separation. Perception is judgemental. Resurrection is the means for return to knowledge. Resurrection was my will uniting with the Father’s will.

2.&emsp;Since the separation, the words “create” and “make” have become confused. 
<sup>2</sup>When you make something, you do so out of a specific sense of lack or need. 
<sup>3</sup>Anything made for a specific purpose has no true generalisability. 
<sup>4</sup>When you make something to fill a perceived lack, you are tacitly implying that you believe in separation. 
<sup>5</sup>The ego has invented many ingenious thought systems for this purpose. 
<sup>6</sup>None of them is creative. 
<sup>7</sup>Inventiveness is wasted effort even in its most ingenious form. 
<sup>8</sup>The highly specific nature of invention is not worthy of the abstract creativity of God’s creations.

“Make” means something made out of a specific sense of lack or need. Making things is believing in separation. The ego makes thought systems. God’s creations have abstract creativity.

#### commentary

:::tip
In *A Course in Miracles*, “make” is reserved for the world of separation or its correction, while “create” refers only to the activity of spirit in Heaven (see, for example, [T-2.VIII.1](/text/2-the-separation-and-the-atonement/viii-the-meaning-of-the-last-judgement#p1); [T-4.I.9:3](/text/4-the-illusions-of-the-ego/i-right-teaching-and-right-learning#p9)).

3.&emsp;Knowing, as we have already observed, does not lead to doing. 
<sup>2</sup>The confusion between your real creation and what you have made of yourself is so profound that it has become literaly impossible for you to know anything. 
<sup>3</sup>Knowledge is always stable, and it is quite evident that you are not. 
<sup>4</sup>Nevertheless, you are perfectly stable as God created you. 
<sup>5</sup>In this sense, when your behavior is unstable, you are disagreeing with God’s idea of your creation. 
<sup>6</sup>You can do this if you choose, but you would hardly want to do it if you were in your right mind.

4.&emsp;The fundamental question you continually ask yourself cannot properly be directed to yourself at all. 
<sup>2</sup>You keep asking what it is you are. 
<sup>3</sup>This implies that the answer is not only one you know, but is also one that is up to you to supply. 
<sup>4</sup>Yet you cannot perceive yourself correctly. 
<sup>5</sup>You have no image to be perceived. 
<sup>6</sup>The word ‘image’ is always perception-related, and not a part of knowledge. 
<sup>7</sup>Images are symbolic and stand for something else. 
<sup>8</sup>The idea of ‘changing your image’ recognises the power of perception, but also implies that there is nothing stable to know.

5.&emsp;Knowing is not open to interpretation. 
<sup>2</sup>You may try to ‘interpret’ meaning, but this is always open to error because it refers to the <em>perception</em> of meaning. 
<sup>3</sup>Such incongruities are the result of attempts to regard yourself as separated and unseparated at the same time. 
<sup>4</sup>It is impossible to make so fundamental a confusion without increasing your overall confusion still further. 
<sup>5</sup>Your mind may have become very ingenious, but as always happens when method and content are separated, it is utilised in a futile attempt to escape from an inescapable impasse. 
<sup>6</sup>Ingenuity is totally divorced from knowledge, because knowledge does not require ingenuity. 
<sup>7</sup>Ingenious thinking is not the truth that shall set you free, but you are free of the need to engage in it when you are willing to let it go.

Let go of ingenious thinking. Ingenious thinking is an effort of the ego to interpret meaning. This effort maintains belief in separation. Knowledge requires no interpretation. 

## T-3.V.6

<p class=fip id=p6>
6.&emsp;Prayer is a way of asking for something. 
<sup>2</sup>It is the medium of miracles. 
<sup>3</sup>But the only meaningful prayer is for forgiveness, because those who have been forgiven have everything. 
<sup>4</sup>Once forgiveness has been accepted, prayer in the usual sense becomes utterly meaningless. 
<sup>5</sup>The prayer for forgiveness is nothing more than a request that you may be able to recognise what you already have. 
<sup>6</sup>In electing perception instead of knowledge, you placed yourself in a position where you could resemble your Father only by perceiving miraculously. 
<sup>7</sup>You have lost the knowledge that you yourself are a miracle of God. 
<sup>8</sup>Creation is your Source and your only real function.

#### commentary

:::tip
(1–5) In other words, one cannot pray for something that is not there. One can only legitimately pray to remmeber or to accept the truth that is already within… We pray for help to forgive (undo) the illusion that there was ever anything but the perfect unity of God and Christ. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 547.)

:::tip
(3, 5) If I believe I have a need, then ovbiously I have to do something about it; the idea behind the miracle (or healing) is that nothing has to be done. This of course does not mean that our bodies do not do things in this world, but simply that we recognise that it is the Holy Spirit’s Love that is “doing” it through us. Our only need, therefore, is to remember that we have no needs. …the miracle simply undoes our faulty belief system, which then inevitably leads to the memory of our one need — the Love of God. (Wapnick, AVI, p.81.)

:::tip
(5) What we “already have” reflects the principle of abundance: God has given us everything in our creation. This abundance has no referent to anything in the material world. Abundance is only of God, and cannot be expressed in what is not in Him. Thus, there can be no connection between the worlds of spirit and materiality, as they reflect mutually exclusive levels: one real, the other illusory. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.122.)

(5) Our prayer, the, should be only for help in accepting the truth that is *already* there, …prayer is no different from forgiveness or the miracle, for they all reflect the process of undoing the ego thought system that never was, leaving to be itself the Love of God that has alway been.

7.&emsp;The statement “God created man in his own image and likeness” needs re-interpretation. 
<sup>2</sup>“Image” can be understood as ‘thought’, and “likeness” as ‘of a like quality’. 
<sup>3</sup>God did create spirit in His Own Thought and of a quality like to His Own. 
<sup>4</sup>There is nothing else. 
<sup>5</sup>Perception, on the other hand, is impossible without a belief in ‘more’ and ‘less’. 
<sup>6</sup>At every level it involves selectivity. 
<sup>7</sup>Perception is a continual process of accepting and rejecting, organising and re-organising, shifting and changing. 
<sup>8</sup>Evaluation is an essential part of perception, because judgements are necessary in order to select.
