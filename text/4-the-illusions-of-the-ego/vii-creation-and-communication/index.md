²Ego illusions are quite specific, although the mind is naturally abstract. 
³Part of the mind becomes concrete, however, when it splits. 
⁴The concrete part believes in the ego, because the ego depends on the concrete. 
⁵The ego is the part of the mind that believes your existence is defined by separation.

The separated self not only has forgotten its *decision* to be on its own, but has forgotten too what it had chosen *against*: the Holy Spirit’s thought system of the Atonement. All that remains within the Son of God’s awareness is his autonomous and individual self, which of course remains an illusion … Nonetheless, within his own deluded mind at least, the Son of God has now made his fantasy into reality, and within this delusion he exists as a separated entity. c/f [T-11.V.4:4–6](/text/11-god-or-the-ego/v-the-dynamics-of-the-ego/#4), [C-in.1:4](/clarification/introduction/#1) (Wapnick, AAC, p.87)

2. Everything the ego perceives is a separate whole, without the relationships that imply being. 
²The ego is thus against communication, except insofar as it is utilised to establish separateness rather than to abolish it. 
³The communication system of the ego is based on its own thought system, as is everything else it dictates. 
⁴Its communication is controlled by its need to protect itself, and it will disrupt communication when it experiences threat. 
⁵This disruption is a reäction to a specific person or persons. 
⁶The specificity of the ego’s thinking, then, results in spurious generalisation which is really not abstract at all. 
⁷It merely responds in certain specific ways to everything it perceives as related.

3. In contrast, spirit reäcts in the same way to everything it knows is true, and does not respond at all to anything else. 
²Nor does it make any attempt to establish what is true. 
³It knows that what is true is everything that God created. 
⁴It is in complete and direct communication with every aspect of creation, because it is in complete and direct communication with its Creator. 
⁵This communication is the Will of God. 
⁶Creation and communication are synonymous. 
⁷God created every mind by communicating His Mind to it, thus establishing it forever as a channel for the reception of His Mind and Will. 
⁸Since only beings of a like order can truly communicate, His creations naturally communicate with Him and like Him. 
⁹This communication is perfectly abstract, since its quality is universal in application and not subject to any judgement, any exception or any alteration. 
¹⁰God created you by this and for this. 
¹¹The mind can distort its function, but it cannot endow itself with functions it was not given. 
¹²That is why the mind cannot totally lose the ability to communicate, even though it may refuse to utilise it on behalf of being.

⁵To whatever extent you permit this state to be curtailed you are limiting your sense of your own reality, which becomes total only by recognising all reality in the glorious context of its real relationship to you. 
⁶This is your reality. 
⁷Do not desecrate it or recoil from it. 
⁸It is your real home, your real temple and your real Self.

(1–4, 6–8) …when the mind appeared to separate from its Source, thereby becoming split, the ego was born. Consequently we now speak of two minds: Mind — one with God; and mind — split off from Him. This split-off mind is what eventually emerges as the full-blown ego, the separated, illusory and ‘sinful’ illusory self. *A Course in Miracles* in fact distinguishes between *being*, which refers only to spirit, the abstract Mind of God or Christ which is the only reality, and *existence*, wihch is the realm of the separated or specific mind, the illusory state of non-being. c/f [5:1,7](#5), [T-6.IV.7:4](/text/6-the-lessons-of-love/iv-the-only-answer/#7) (Wapnick, LDNC, p.494; AAC, p.145)
