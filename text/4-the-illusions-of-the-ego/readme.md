2.&emsp;Many stand guard over their ideas because they want to protect their thought systems as they are, and learning means change. 
<sup>2</sup>Change is always fearful to the separated, because they cannot conceive of it as a move towards healing the separation. 
<sup>3</sup>They always perceive it as a move toward further separation, because the separation was their first experience of change. 
<sup>4</sup>You believe that if you allow no change to enter into your ego you will find peace. 
<sup>5</sup>This profound confusion is possible only if you maintain that the same thought system can stand on two foundations. 
<sup>6</sup>Nothing can reach spirit from the ego, and nothing can reach the ego from spirit. 
<sup>7</sup>Spirit can neither strengthen the ego nor reduce the conflict within it. 
<sup>8</sup>The ego <em>is</em> a contradiction. 
<sup>9</sup>Your self and God’s Self <em>are</em> in opposition. 
<sup>10</sup>They are opposed in source, in direction and in outcome. 
<sup>11</sup>They are fundamentally irreconcilable, because spirit cannot perceive and the ego cannot know. 
<sup>12</sup>They are therefore not in communication and can never be in communication. 
<sup>13</sup>Nevertheless, the ego can learn, even though its maker can be misguided. 
<sup>14</sup>He cannot, however, make the totally lifeless out of the life-given.

<sup>5</sup>‘Giving to get’ is an inescapable law of the ego, which always evaluates ego’s-self in relation to other egos. 
<sup>6</sup>The ego is therefore continually preoccupied with the belief in scarcity that gave rise to the ego. 
<sup>7</sup>The-ego’s whole perception of other egos as real is only an attempt to convince the-ego’s-self that <em>the ego</em> is real. 
<sup>8</sup>‘Self-esteem’ in ego terms means nothing more than that the ego has deluded the-ego’s-self into accepting the-ego’s reality, and is therefore temporarily less predatory. 
<sup>9</sup>This ‘self-esteem’ is always vulnerable to stress; the term stress refers to any perceived threat to the ego’s existence.

#### simplified

If you have a sense of abundance you can give with true charity. Ego giving is giving up someting, with hope of bigger return later. The ego was created out of scarcity. The ego believes in scarcity. Self-esteeem is a delusion. Self-esteem is always vulnerable to stress, because self-esteem can be threatened.

(6–7) How could God have given an Answer to a problem that the Course states clearly does not exist, and that God does even know about? …we can see the Course using language metaphorically, words that are not to be taken as literal truth. This is why we have spoken of the Course’s mythology, however psychologically spphisticated its form. God does not think, weep, nor give answers, any more than He makes things happen in the world, heal physical illness, nor end human suffering. These are metaphoric expressions Jesus (himself a symbol) uses in the Course to express the love of God that cannot be expressed except through such literary and anthropomorphic devices. c/f [T-18.VIII.1:7](/text/18-the-passing-of-the-dream/viii-the-little-garden.html#p1) (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 459) (In other words, if Ken Wapnick does not agree with something the course says, it must be either myth, metaphor or symbol.

4.&emsp;You who identify with your ego cannot believe God loves you. 
<sup>2</sup>You do not love what you made, and what you made does not love you. 
<sup>3</sup>Being made out of the denial of the Father, the ego has no allegiance to its maker. 
<sup>4</sup>You cannot conceive of the real relationship that exists between God and His creations because of your hatred for the self you made. 
<sup>5</sup>You project onto the ego the decision to separate, and this conflicts with the love you feel for the ego because you made it. 
<sup>6</sup>No love in this world is without this ambivalence, and since no ego has experienced love without ambivalence the concept is beyond its understanding. 
<sup>7</sup>Love will enter immediately into any mind that truly wants it, but it must want it truly. 
<sup>8</sup>This means that it wants it without ambivalence, and this kind of wanting is wholly without the ego’s ‘drive to get’.

(1–2) Honesty with oneself regarding the investment in specialness is essential to the process of forgiveness, for it undoes denial and projection, the ego’s ‘double shield’ that protecs its guilt and therefore its own existence. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.181)
:::

::: tip
(1–3) …Jesus’ role in the Holy Spirit’s plan for our salvation is to help us draw away the ego’s veil that kept *its* plan of individuality, guilt, and mindlessness hidden from our awareness. Calling on his help reflects our little willngness finally to see within our minds the seeming terror we once believed was there, and which became protected by the world and the body. Reaching for Jesus’ hand means choosing to look at what our ego is up to, and has always been up to. Our choice for Jesus is born of the honesty to bring to him all our darkest thoughts and wishes. This would have to include, acknowledging the ego’s goal, the desire to kill even him, not to mention everyone else, in order to satisfy our craving for specialness and to ensure the continuation of our individuality. 

Our looking with Jesus therefore entails allowing ourselves finally to be aware — without judgement, fear or guilt — of the ugly murderousness that results from our need to protect and preserve our individual existence. This inherent selfishness of the separated self is not concerned with the cost of upholding individuality. As long as its craving for survival is satsified, moreover, it does not care who must pay the price, as long as it is not itself, and even if it means the seeming life of another. c/f [T-4.IV.2:4–6](/text/4-the-illusions-of-the-ego/iv-this-need-not-be#p2) (Wapnick, AAC, p. 191)

(1) Aside from the obvious reference to his own crucifixion, Jesus uses the term as a symbol for the ego thought system of suffering, sacrifice and death. While the ego’s journey is therefore useless and goes nowhere, the Holy Spirit’s journey for us leads away from the dream of death — symbolised by the cross — by awakening us.

To feel victimised by the actions or decisions of others, or helpless in the face of “natural forces” or the forces of sickness, are all different names for the same mistake of believing that God is unjust and that we are His victims, deserving His punishment because of our sinfulness.

You can change your mind. When you are not joyous you have chosen wrongly. Choose to align your mind with God’s mind. Your mind is one with God’s mind. But denying your mind’s oneness with God, creates a split mind and identifies with the ego. See in yourself and in your brother that you are all glorious creations of God.

#### commentary

:::tip
(1–3) These are very clear statements of the end of the ego, as well as Jesus’ statement that he is no different from us. The First Coming of Christ is not the birth of Jesus, but rather is the creation of the Sonship of which he is a part. It was then that the ego’s dream appeared to be born, necessitating the Atonement correction. When the Atonement is complete and the Sonship awakens from the dream, the Second Coming of Christ dawns. And Jesus is asking us to join in that process with him, which he “undertook to begin” ([T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles)) (Wapnick, AVI, p.228)
:::

:::tip
(4) Jesus says he is in charge of the Atonement [T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles), and the teacher’s manual states that the Holy Spirit established Jesus as the leader of the plan of the Atonement ([C-6.2:2](/clarification/6-the-holy-spirit.html#p2)). The meaning here is the same. Moreover, again, his judgement clearly lacks the implication of punishment or attack that is central to the traditional view. Jesus’ judgement is simply that the separation never happened, and so our pain and suffering not only is not warranted, but is inherently nonexistent, its cause of sin having been undone. Thus we are ‘protected’ from the ego’s thought system by the truth of the Atonement. (Wapnick, AVI, p.228–229)

<sup>6</sup>Nothing can reach spirit from the ego, and nothing can reach the ego from spirit.

<sup>8</sup>The ego <em>is</em> a contradiction. 
<sup>9</sup>Your self and God’s Self <em>are</em> in opposition. 
<sup>10</sup>They are opposed in source, in direction and in outcome. 
<sup>11</sup>They are fundamentally irreconcilable, because spirit cannot perceive and the ego cannot know. 
<sup>12</sup>They are therefore not in communication and can never be in communication. 
<sup>13</sup>Nevertheless, the ego can learn, even though its maker can be misguided. 
<sup>14</sup>He cannot, however, make the totally lifeless out of the life-given.

<sup>2</sup>This is obvious when you consider what is involved. 
<sup>3</sup>To the ego, to give anything implies that you will have to do without it. 
<sup>4</sup>When you associate giving with sacrifice, you give only because you believe that you are somehow getting something better, and can therefore do without the thing you give. 
<sup>5</sup>‘Giving to get’ is an inescapable law of the ego, which always evaluates itself in relation to other egos. 
<sup>6</sup>It is therefore continually preoccupied with the belief in scarcity that gave rise to it. 
<sup>7</sup>Its whole perception of other egos as real is only an attempt to convince itself that <em>it</em> is real. 
<sup>8</sup>‘Self-esteem’ in ego terms means nothing more than that the ego has deluded itself into accepting its reality, and is therefore temporarily less predatory. 
<sup>9</sup>This ‘self-esteem’ is always vulnerable to stress, a term which refers to any perceived threat to the ego’s existence.

#### simplified

If you have a sense of abundance you can give with true charity. Ego giving is giving up someting, with hope of bigger return later. The ego was created out of scarcity. The ego believes in scarcity. Self-esteeem is a delusion. Self-esteem is always vulnerable to stress, because self-esteem can be threatened.

<sup>7</sup>Body appetites are not physical in origin.

(6–7) How could God have given an Answer to a problem that the Course states clearly does not exist, and that God does even know about? …we can see the Course using language metaphorically, words that are not to be taken as literal truth. This is why we have spoken of the Course’s mythology, however psychologically spphisticated its form. God does not think, weep, nor give answers, any more than He makes things happen in the world, heal physical illness, nor end human suffering. These are metaphoric expressions Jesus (himself a symbol) uses in the Course to express the love of God that cannot be expressed except through such literary and anthropomorphic devices. c/f [T-18.VIII.1:7](/text/18-the-passing-of-the-dream/viii-the-little-garden.html#p1) (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 459) (In other words, if Ken Wapnick does not agree with something the course says, it must be either myth, metaphor or symbol.

4.&emsp;You who identify with your ego cannot believe God loves you. 
<sup>2</sup>You do not love what you made, and what you made does not love you. 
<sup>3</sup>Being made out of the denial of the Father, the ego has no allegiance to its maker. 
<sup>4</sup>You cannot conceive of the real relationship that exists between God and His creations because of your hatred for the self you made. 
<sup>5</sup>You project onto the ego the decision to separate, and this conflicts with the love you feel for the ego because you made it. 
<sup>6</sup>No love in this world is without this ambivalence, and since no ego has experienced love without ambivalence the concept is beyond its understanding. 
<sup>7</sup>Love will enter immediately into any mind that truly wants it, but it must want it truly. 
<sup>8</sup>This means that it wants it without ambivalence, and this kind of wanting is wholly without the ego’s ‘drive to get’.

(1–2) Honesty with oneself regarding the investment in specialness is essential to the process of forgiveness, for it undoes denial and projection, the ego’s ‘double shield’ that protecs its guilt and therefore its own existence. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.181)
:::

::: tip
(1–3) …Jesus’ role in the Holy Spirit’s plan for our salvation is to help us draw away the ego’s veil that kept *its* plan of individuality, guilt, and mindlessness hidden from our awareness. Calling on his help reflects our little willngness finally to see within our minds the seeming terror we once believed was there, and which became protected by the world and the body. Reaching for Jesus’ hand means choosing to look at what our ego is up to, and has always been up to. Our choice for Jesus is born of the honesty to bring to him all our darkest thoughts and wishes. This would have to include, acknowledging the ego’s goal, the desire to kill even him, not to mention everyone else, in order to satisfy our craving for specialness and to ensure the continuation of our individuality. 

Our looking with Jesus therefore entails allowing ourselves finally to be aware — without judgement, fear or guilt — of the ugly murderousness that results from our need to protect and preserve our individual existence. This inherent selfishness of the separated self is not concerned with the cost of upholding individuality. As long as its craving for survival is satsified, moreover, it does not care who must pay the price, as long as it is not itself, and even if it means the seeming life of another. c/f [T-4.IV.2:4–6](/text/4-the-illusions-of-the-ego/iv-this-need-not-be#p2) (Wapnick, AAC, p. 191)

:::tip
(1) Aside from the obvious reference to his own crucifixion, Jesus uses the term as a symbol for the ego thought system of suffering, sacrifice and death. While the ego’s journey is therefore useless and goes nowhere, the Holy Spirit’s journey for us leads away from the dream of death — symbolised by the cross — by awakening us. (Wapnick, AVI, p.140)

:::tip
(1,2,7–10) We are certainly *not* asked to take as our model what Christianity taught to be the sacrificial suffering of Jesus’s death. (Wapnick, CP, p.75)
:::

:::tip
(1–3, 7–10) The crucifixion is the symbol of suffering, sacrifice, and the death of innocence at the hands of sin. To feel victimised by the actions or decisions of others, or helpless in the face of “natural forces” or the forces of sickness, are all different names for the same mistake of believing that God is unjust and that we are His victims, deserving His punishment because of our sinfulness.

The First Coming of Christ was when the Son of God was created. The Second Coming of Christ is when the ego ends and your mind is healed. I choose you to join with me. You might think I make a mistake in calling you. The ego wants you to think I am not real.

#### commentary

:::tip
(1–3) These are very clear statements of the end of the ego, as well as Jesus’ statement that he is no different from us. The First Coming of Christ is not the birth of Jesus, but rather is the creation of the Sonship of which he is a part. It was then that the ego’s dream appeared to be born, necessitating the Atonement correction. When the Atonement is complete and the Sonship awakens from the dream, the Second Coming of Christ dawns. And Jesus is asking us to join in that process with him, which he “undertook to begin” ([T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles)) (Wapnick, AVI, p.228)

:::tip
(4) Jesus says he is in charge of the Atonement [T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles), and the teacher’s manual states that the Holy Spirit established Jesus as the leader of the plan of the Atonement ([C-6.2:2](/clarification/6-the-holy-spirit.html#p2)). The meaning here is the same. Moreover, again, his judgement clearly lacks the implication of punishment or attack that is central to the traditional view. Jesus’ judgement is simply that the separation never happened, and so our pain and suffering not only is not warranted, but is inherently nonexistent, its cause of sin having been undone. Thus we are ‘protected’ from the ego’s thought system by the truth of the Atonement. (Wapnick, AVI, p.228–229)

2. A major source of the ego’s off-balanced state is its lack of discrimination between the body and the Thoughts of God. 
<sup>2</sup>Thoughts of God are unacceptable to the ego, because they clearly point to the non-existence of the ego itself. 
<sup>3</sup>The ego therefore either distorts them or refuses to accept them. 
<sup>4</sup>It cannot, however, make them cease to be. 
<sup>5</sup>It therefore tries to conceal not only ‘unacceptable’ body impulses, but also the Thoughts of God, because both are threatening to it. 
<sup>6</sup>Being concerned primarily with its own preservation in the face of threat, the ego perceives them as the same. 
<sup>7</sup>By perceiving them as the same, the ego attempts to save itself from being swept away, as it would surely be in the presence of knowledge.

The ego tells the mind that the mind is part of the body, but the body can’t protect the mind. The ego offers to protect the mind instead. The mind does not feel protected by the ego because the ego told the mind that the mind was part of the body in the first place. The ego pushes the uneasiness of feeling unprotected out of awareness.

:::tip
(5–11) …this clever description of the final stage in the ego’s strategy of not having the Son remember what it is really up to. …[referring] to the body as a defence against fear  …[an] example of the ego’s ability to bring abou tthe Son’s amnesia …the ego attempts to convince the Son to trust it. And when the Son recognises the clearly paradoxical and contradictory advice the ego gives him, *and complains about it*, the ego responds by simply not responding. (Wapnick, AAC, p.50)

:::tip
(9–11) Once the thought that God created this world is accorded truth, the ego can safely rest. Whatever inconsistencies may from time to time appear within the consciousness of individuals are quickly disposed of, either by the ego’s “appeal to ‘mysteries’, insisting that you must accept the meaningless to save yourself” ([T-9.IV.4:7](/text/9-the-acceptance-of-the-atonement/iv-the-holy-spirits-plan-of-forgiveness#p4)), or by repression. Once pushed out of awareness, these inconsistent thoughts are no longer accessible to question and revision. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.571–572)

The separated self not only has forgotten its *decision* to be on its own, but has forgotten too what it had chosen *against*: the Holy Spirit’s thought system of the Atonement. All that remains within the Son of God’s awareness is his autonomous and individual self, which of course remains an illusion … Nonetheless, within his own deluded mind at least, the Son of God has now made his fantasy into reality, and within this delusion he exists as a separated entity. c/f [T-11.V.4:4–6](/text/11-god-or-the-ego/v-the-dynamics-of-the-ego#p4), [C-in.1:4](/clarification/introduction#p1) (Wapnick, AAC, p.87)

4.&emsp;Existence as well as being rest on communication. 
<sup>2</sup>Existence, however, is specific in how, what and with whom communication is judged to be worth undertaking. 
<sup>3</sup>Being is completely without these distinctions. 
<sup>4</sup>Being is a state, in state the mind is in communication with everything that is real. 
<sup>5</sup>To whatever extent you permit the state — the state where the mind is in communication with everything that is real — to be curtailed, you are limiting your sense of your own reality; your sense of your own reality becomes total only by recognising all reality in the glorious context of all-reality’s real relationship to you. 
<sup>6</sup>That all reality is related to you, is your reality.

#### simplified

Existence is specific in how it communicates. Being is in communication with everything that is real. Do not limit your state of communication. You know your own reality when you communicate with all of reality.

:::tip
(1–4, 6–8) …when the mind appeared to separate from its Source, thereby becoming split, the ego was born. Consequently we now speak of two minds: Mind — one with God; and mind — split off from Him. This split-off mind is what eventually emerges as the full-blown ego, the separated, illusory and ‘sinful’ illusory self. *A Course in Miracles* in fact distinguishes between *being*, which refers only to spirit, the abstract Mind of God or Christ which is the only reality, and *existence*, wihch is the realm of the separated or specific mind, the illusory state of non-being. c/f [5:1,7](#p5), [T-6.IV.7:4](/text/6-the-lessons-of-love/iv-the-only-answer#p7) (Wapnick, LDNC, p.494; AAC, p.145) (But note there are numerous parts of the text that speak of God as Creator and we, with our brothers, are his creations –Ed.)

<sup>5</sup>And this He does know.

<sup>7</sup>The constant going out of His Love is blocked when His channels are closed, and He is lonely when the minds He created do not communicate fully with Him.

8. God is praised whenever any mind learns to be wholly helpful.

<sup>3</sup>The truly helpful are invulnerable, because they are not protecting their egos and so nothing can hurt them.

<sup>5</sup>God goes out to them and through them, and there is great joy throughout the Kingdom. 
<sup>6</sup>Every mind that is changed adds to this joy with its individual willingness to share in it. 
<sup>7</sup>The truly helpful are God’s miracle workers, whom I direct until we are all united in the joy of the Kingdom. 
<sup>8</sup>I will direct you to wherever you can be truly helpful, and to whoever can follow my guidance through you.

Being helpful and being harmless goes together. The truly helpful do not protect their ego and therefore can neither harm nor be harmed. The truly helpful praise God and rejoice with God. I will direct you to where you can be truly helpful. I will direct you to those who can follow my guidance through you.
