#### commentary

:::tip
The separated self not only has forgotten its *decision* to be on its own, but has forgotten too what it had chosen *against*: the Holy Spirit’s thought system of the Atonement. All that remains within the Son of God’s awareness is his autonomous and individual self, which of course remains an illusion … Nonetheless, within his own deluded mind at least, the Son of God has now made his fantasy into reality, and within this delusion he exists as a separated entity. c/f [T-11.V.4:4–6](/text/11-god-or-the-ego/v-the-dynamics-of-the-ego#p4), [C-in.1:4](/clarification/introduction#p1) (Wapnick, AAC, p.87)

2.&emsp;Everything the ego perceives is a separate whole, without the relationships that imply being. 
<sup>2</sup>The ego is thus against communication, except insofar as it is utilised to establish separateness rather than to abolish it. 
<sup>3</sup>The communication system of the ego is based on its own thought system, as is everything else it dictates. 
<sup>4</sup>Its communication is controlled by its need to protect itself, and it will disrupt communication when it experiences threat. 
<sup>5</sup>This disruption is a reaction to a specific person or persons. 
<sup>6</sup>The specificity of the ego’s thinking, then, results in spurious generalisation which is really not abstract at all. 
<sup>7</sup>It merely responds in certain specific ways to everything it perceives as related.

Spirit communicates with all aspects of creation. God creates by communication and for communication. God’s creations communicate with God and with each other, communicating like God. The mind always has the ability to communicate. The mind can refuse to communicate at times.

:::tip
(1–4, 6–8) …when the mind appeared to separate from its Source, thereby becoming split, the ego was born. Consequently we now speak of two minds: Mind — one with God; and mind — split off from Him. This split-off mind is what eventually emerges as the full-blown ego, the separated, illusory and ‘sinful’ illusory self. *A Course in Miracles* in fact distinguishes between *being*, which refers only to spirit, the abstract Mind of God or Christ which is the only reality, and *existence*, wihch is the realm of the separated or specific mind, the illusory state of non-being. c/f [5:1,7](#p5), [T-6.IV.7:4](/text/6-the-lessons-of-love/iv-the-only-answer#p7) (Wapnick, LDNC, p.494; AAC, p.145) (But note there are numerous parts of the text that speak of God as Creator and we, with our brothers, are his creations –Ed.)

<sup>5</sup>That is what creation means.

6.&emsp;The Bible repeatedly states that you should praise God.

<sup>5</sup>And this He does know. 
<sup>6</sup>He knows it in His Own Being and its experience of His Son’s experience. 
<sup>7</sup>The constant going out of His Love is blocked when His channels are closed, and He is lonely when the minds He created do not communicate fully with Him.
