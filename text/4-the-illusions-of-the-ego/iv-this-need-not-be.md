1.&emsp;If you cannot hear the Voice for God, it is because you do not choose to listen. 
<sup>2</sup>That you *do* listen to the voice of your ego is demonstrated by your attitudes, your feelings and your behaviour.

<sup>4</sup>This is what you are fighting to keep, and what you are vigilant to save. 
<sup>5</sup>Your mind is filled with schemes to save the face of your ego, and you do not seek the face of Christ. 
<sup>6</sup>The glass in which the ego seeks to see its face is dark indeed. 
<sup>7</sup>How can it maintain the trick of its existence except with mirrors? 
<sup>8</sup>But where you look to find yourself is up to you.

<sup>7</sup>Your mind is one with God’s. 
<sup>8</sup>Denying this and thinking otherwise has held your ego together, but has literally split your mind. 
<sup>9</sup>As a loving brother I am deeply concerned with your mind, and urge you to follow my example as you look at yourself and at your brother, and see in both the glorious creations of a glorious Father.

You can change your mind. When you are not joyous you have chosen wrongly. Choose to align your mind with God’s mind. Your mind is one with God’s mind. But denying your mind’s oneness with God, creates a split mind and identifies with the ego. See in yourself and in your brother that you are all glorious creations of God.
