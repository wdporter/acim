1.&emsp;It is reasonable to ask how the mind could ever have made the ego. 
<sup>2</sup>In fact, it is the best question you could ask. 
<sup>3</sup>There is, however, no point in giving an answer in terms of the past because the past does not matter, and history would not exist if the same errors were not being repeated in the present. 
<sup>4</sup>Abstract thought applies to knowledge because knowledge is completely impersonal, and examples are irrelevant to its understanding. 
<sup>5</sup>Perception, however, is always specific, and therefore quite concrete.

You make an ego for yourself. And you make an ego for everyone you perceive. Egos are unstable. When they interact with each other, they change. Egos can be changed just by thinking about them. By this we know ego is not a fact.

You love what you create. You consider what you create part of your self. What do you believe you are? The ego does not believe you are God’s creation. The highest idea the ego can think is that there is another way of perceiving. Believing there is another way of perceiving is a recognition the ego is not the Self.

<sup>6</sup>It is therefore continually preoccupied with the belief in scarcity that gave rise to it. 
<sup>7</sup>Its whole perception of other egos as real is only an attempt to convince itself that <em>it</em> is real. 
<sup>8</sup>‘Self-esteem’ in ego terms means nothing more than that the ego has deluded itself into accepting its reality, and is therefore temporarily less predatory. 
<sup>9</sup>This ‘self-esteem’ is always vulnerable to stress, a term which refers to any perceived threat to the ego’s existence.

:::tip
(6–7) How could God have given an Answer to a problem that the Course states clearly does not exist, and that God does even know about? …we can see the Course using language metaphorically, words that are not to be taken as literal truth. This is why we have spoken of the Course’s mythology, however psychologically spphisticated its form. God does not think, weep, nor give answers, any more than He makes things happen in the world, heal physical illness, nor end human suffering. These are metaphoric expressions Jesus (himself a symbol) uses in the Course to express the love of God that cannot be expressed except through such literary and anthropomorphic devices. c/f [T-18.VIII.1:7](/text/18-the-passing-of-the-dream/viii-the-little-garden.html#p1) (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 459) (In other words, if Ken Wapnick does not agree with something the course says, it must be either myth, metaphor or symbol. Wapnick’s approach to interpretation is not universally shared amongst course scholars. —Ed.)

9.&emsp;Myths and magic are closely associated, since myths are usually related to ego origins, and magic to the powers the ego ascribes to the-ego’s-self. 
<sup>2</sup>Mythological systems generally include some account of ‘the creation,’ and associate an account of the creation with the-mythological-system’s particular form of magic. 
<sup>3</sup>The so-called ‘battle for survival’ is only the ego’s struggle to preserve the-ego’s-self, and the-ego’s interpretation of the-ego’s own beginning. 
<sup>4</sup>The ego’s beginning is usually associated with physical birth, because it is hard to maintain that the ego existed before the point in time of physical birth. 
<sup>5</sup>The more ‘religiously’ ego-oriented may believe that the soul existed before physical birth, and will continue to exist after a temporary lapse into ego life. 
<sup>6</sup>Some even believe that the soul will be punished for this lapse into ego life. 
<sup>7</sup>However, salvation does not apply to spirit; spirit is not in danger and does not need to be salvaged.

Spirit does not need salvation for any reason.

Salvation is right-mindedness. Right mindedness is not the One-mindedness of the Holy Spirit. Right-mindedness must be achieved before One-mindedness can be restored. Right-mindedness is without attack and without judgement. Right-mindedness is the end of wrong-mindedness. The ego is laid aside. The mind is directed automatically to One-mindedness.

11.&emsp;It cannot be emphasised too often that correcting perception is merely a temporary expedient.

<sup>3</sup>The whole value of right perception lies in the inevitable realisation that <em>all</em> perception is unnecessary. 
<sup>4</sup>This removes the block entirely. 
<sup>5</sup>You may ask how this is possible as long as you appear to be living in this world. 
<sup>6</sup>That is a reasonable question. 
<sup>7</sup>You must be careful, however, that you really understand it. 
<sup>8</sup>Who is the ‘you’ who are living in this world?

<sup>10</sup>It is as true now as it ever was or ever will be, because it implies no change at all. 
<sup>11</sup>It is not a continuum, nor is it understood by being compared to an opposite. 
<sup>12</sup>Knowledge never involves comparisons.

Correct perception to be free of misperception. The use accurate perception to gain knowledge. All perception is unnecessary. You are spirit, spirit is immortal, immortality does not change. Knowledge does not compare because there is no opposite to immortality.

(8) The ‘you’ who are the observer is outside of time and space, and therefore is outside of Crompond, New York, 1985. In other words, the ‘you’ who are the observer in the mind is not identical with the ‘you’ who are sitting here at this table. (Wapnick, AVI, p.37)
