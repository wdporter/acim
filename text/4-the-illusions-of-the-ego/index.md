# T-4.I Right Teaching and Right Learning

## T-4.I.1

<p class=fip id=p1>
1. A good teacher clarifies his own ideas and strengthens them by teaching them. 
²Teacher and pupil are alike in the learning process. 
³They are in the same order of learning, and unless they share their lessons conviction will be lacking. 
⁴A good teacher must believe in the ideas he teaches, but he must meet another condition: he must believe in the students to whom he offers the ideas.

2. Many stand guard over their ideas because they want to protect their thought systems as they are, and learning means change. 
²Change is always fearful to the separated, because they cannot conceive of it as a move towards healing the separation. 
³They always perceive it as a move toward further separation, because the separation was their first experience of change. 
⁴You believe that if you allow no change to enter into your ego you will find peace. 
⁵This profound confusion is possible only if you maintain that the same thought system can stand on two foundations. 
⁶Nothing can reach spirit from the ego, and nothing can reach the ego from spirit. 
⁷Spirit can neither strengthen the ego nor reduce the conflict within it. 
⁸The ego <em>is</em> a contradiction. 
⁹Your self and God’s Self <em>are</em> in opposition. 
¹⁰They are opposed in source, in direction and in outcome. 
¹¹They are fundamentally irreconcilable, because spirit cannot perceive and the ego cannot know. 
¹²They are therefore not in communication and can never be in communication. 
¹³Nevertheless, the ego can learn, even though its maker can be misguided. 
¹⁴He cannot, however, make the totally lifeless out of the life-given.

The ego believes it is on its own. The ego tries to unite with other egos, or attack other egos. The ego tries to be recognised by spirit. The ego can’t be recognised by spirit, so the ego has a sense of being rejected.


#### commentary

:::tip
(6–7) How could God have given an Answer to a problem that the Course states clearly does not exist, and that God does even know about? …we can see the Course using language metaphorically, words that are not to be taken as literal truth. This is why we have spoken of the Course’s mythology, however psychologically spphisticated its form. God does not think, weep, nor give answers, any more than He makes things happen in the world, heal physical illness, nor end human suffering. These are metaphoric expressions Jesus (himself a symbol) uses in the Course to express the love of God that cannot be expressed except through such literary and anthropomorphic devices. c/f [T-18.VIII.1:7](/text/18-the-passing-of-the-dream/viii-the-little-garden.html#p1) (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 459) 

(In other words, if Ken Wapnick does not agree with something the course says, it must be either myth, metaphor or symbol. —Ed.)

²Mythological systems generally include some account of ‘the creation,’ and associate this with its particular form of magic. 
³The so-called ‘battle for survival’ is only the ego’s struggle to preserve itself, and its interpretation of its own beginning. 
⁴This beginning is usually associated with physical birth, because it is hard to maintain that the ego existed before that point in time. 
⁵The more ‘religiously’ ego-oriented may believe that the soul existed before, and will continue to exist after a temporary lapse into ego life. 
⁶Some even believe that the soul will be punished for this lapse. 
⁷However, salvation does not apply to spirit, which is not in danger and does not need to be salvaged.

(1–2) Honesty with oneself regarding the investment in specialness is essential to the process of forgiveness, for it undoes denial and projection, the ego’s ‘double shield’ that protecs its guilt and therefore its own existence. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.181)
:::

::: tip
(1–3) …Jesus’ role in the Holy Spirit’s plan for our salvation is to help us draw away the ego’s veil that kept *its* plan of individuality, guilt, and mindlessness hidden from our awareness. Calling on his help reflects our little willngness finally to see within our minds the seeming terror we once believed was there, and which became protected by the world and the body. Reaching for Jesus’ hand means choosing to look at what our ego is up to, and has always been up to. Our choice for Jesus is born of the honesty to bring to him all our darkest thoughts and wishes. This would have to include, acknowledging the ego’s goal, the desire to kill even him, not to mention everyone else, in order to satisfy our craving for specialness and to ensure the continuation of our individuality. 

Our looking with Jesus therefore entails allowing ourselves finally to be aware — without judgement, fear or guilt — of the ugly murderousness that results from our need to protect and preserve our individual existence. This inherent selfishness of the separated self is not concerned with the cost of upholding individuality. As long as its craving for survival is satsified, moreover, it does not care who must pay the price, as long as it is not itself, and even if it means the seeming life of another. c/f [T-4.IV.2:4–6](/text/4-the-illusions-of-the-ego/iv-this-need-not-be#p2) (Wapnick, AAC, p. 191)

(1) Aside from the obvious reference to his own crucifixion, Jesus uses the term as a symbol for the ego thought system of suffering, sacrifice and death. While the ego’s journey is therefore useless and goes nowhere, the Holy Spirit’s journey for us leads away from the dream of death — symbolised by the cross — by awakening us. (Wapnick, AVI, p.140)

(1–3, 7–10) The crucifixion is the symbol of suffering, sacrifice, and the death of innocence at the hands of sin. To feel victimised by the actions or decisions of others, or helpless in the face of “natural forces” or the forces of sickness, are all different names for the same mistake of believing that God is unjust and that we are His victims, deserving His punishment because of our sinfulness.

(9–10) The ego is aware of a power greater than itself, to which it owes its existence, and this power is the Son’s mind that has chosen — through what *I have termed* the decision maker — to believe in the ego’s thought system. The ego knows that at any moment the Son can withdraw its belief in it, and then it, and the thought system of separation that it represents will inevitably disappear. And this is the threat experienced by the ego. c/f [T-7.VII.4:6](/text/7-the-gifts-of-the-kingdom/vii-the-totality-of-the-kingdom#p4), [5:1–2](/text/7-the-gifts-of-the-kingdom/vii-the-totality-of-the-kingdom#p5), [6:2–3](/text/7-the-gifts-of-the-kingdom/vii-the-totality-of-the-kingdom#p6) (Wapnick, AAC, p.33–34) (italics mine.

#### commentary

:::tip
(1–3) These are very clear statements of the end of the ego, as well as Jesus’ statement that he is no different from us. The First Coming of Christ is not the birth of Jesus, but rather is the creation of the Sonship of which he is a part. It was then that the ego’s dream appeared to be born, necessitating the Atonement correction. When the Atonement is complete and the Sonship awakens from the dream, the Second Coming of Christ dawns. And Jesus is asking us to join in that process with him, which he “undertook to begin” ([T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles)) (Wapnick, AVI, p.228)
:::

:::tip
(4) Jesus says he is in charge of the Atonement [T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles), and the teacher’s manual states that the Holy Spirit established Jesus as the leader of the plan of the Atonement ([C-6.2:2](/clarification/6-the-holy-spirit.html#p2)). The meaning here is the same. Moreover, again, his judgement clearly lacks the implication of punishment or attack that is central to the traditional view. Jesus’ judgement is simply that the separation never happened, and so our pain and suffering not only is not warranted, but is inherently nonexistent, its cause of sin having been undone. Thus we are ‘protected’ from the ego’s thought system by the truth of the Atonement. (Wapnick, AVI, p.228–229)

You make an ego for yourself. And you make an ego for everyone you perceive. Egos are unstable. When they interact with each other, they change. Egos can be changed just by thinking about them. By this we know ego is not a fact.

(6–7) How could God have given an Answer to a problem that the Course states clearly does not exist, and that God does even know about? …we can see the Course using language metaphorically, words that are not to be taken as literal truth. This is why we have spoken of the Course’s mythology, however psychologically spphisticated its form. God does not think, weep, nor give answers, any more than He makes things happen in the world, heal physical illness, nor end human suffering. These are metaphoric expressions Jesus (himself a symbol) uses in the Course to express the love of God that cannot be expressed except through such literary and anthropomorphic devices. c/f [T-18.VIII.1:7](/text/18-the-passing-of-the-dream/viii-the-little-garden.html#p1) (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 459)

11. It cannot be emphasised too often that correcting perception is merely a temporary expedient. 
²Correcting perception is necessary only because misperception is a block to knowledge, while accurate perception is a stepping-stone towards knowledge. 
³The whole value of right perception lies in the inevitable realisation that <em>all</em> perception is unnecessary. 
⁴Realising all perception is unecessary removes the block to knowledge entirely. 
⁵You may ask how realising all perception is unnecessary, is possible as long as you appear to be living in this world. 
⁶How is realising all perception is unnecessary? is a reasonable question. 
⁷You must be careful, however, that you really understand the question.

Correct perception to be free of misperception. The use accurate perception to gain knowledge. All perception is unnecessary. You are spirit, spirit is immortal, immortality does not change. Knowledge does not compare because there is no opposite to immortality.

(1–2) Honesty with oneself regarding the investment in specialness is essential to the process of forgiveness, for it undoes denial and projection, the ego’s ‘double shield’ that protecs its guilt and therefore its own existence. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.181)
:::

::: tip
(1–3) …Jesus’ role in the Holy Spirit’s plan for our salvation is to help us draw away the ego’s veil that kept *its* plan of individuality, guilt, and mindlessness hidden from our awareness. Calling on his help reflects our little willngness finally to see within our minds the seeming terror we once believed was there, and which became protected by the world and the body. Reaching for Jesus’ hand means choosing to look at what our ego is up to, and has always been up to. Our choice for Jesus is born of the honesty to bring to him all our darkest thoughts and wishes. This would have to include, acknowledging the ego’s goal, the desire to kill even him, not to mention everyone else, in order to satisfy our craving for specialness and to ensure the continuation of our individuality. 

Our looking with Jesus therefore entails allowing ourselves finally to be aware — without judgement, fear or guilt — of the ugly murderousness that results from our need to protect and preserve our individual existence. This inherent selfishness of the separated self is not concerned with the cost of upholding individuality. As long as its craving for survival is satsified, moreover, it does not care who must pay the price, as long as it is not itself, and even if it means the seeming life of another. c/f [T-4.IV.2:4–6](/text/4-the-illusions-of-the-ego/iv-this-need-not-be#p2) (Wapnick, AAC, p. 191)

⁷To be egocentric is to be dis-spirited, but to be Self-centered in the right sense is to be inspired or in spirit.

:::tip
(1) Aside from the obvious reference to his own crucifixion, Jesus uses the term as a symbol for the ego thought system of suffering, sacrifice and death. While the ego’s journey is therefore useless and goes nowhere, the Holy Spirit’s journey for us leads away from the dream of death — symbolised by the cross — by awakening us. (Wapnick, AVI, p.140)

(1,2,7–10) We are certainly *not* asked to take as our model what Christianity taught to be the sacrificial suffering of Jesus’s death. (Wapnick, CP, p.75)

:::tip
(1–3, 7–10) The crucifixion is the symbol of suffering, sacrifice, and the death of innocence at the hands of sin. To feel victimised by the actions or decisions of others, or helpless in the face of “natural forces” or the forces of sickness, are all different names for the same mistake of believing that God is unjust and that we are His victims, deserving His punishment because of our sinfulness.

#### commentary

:::tip
(1–3) These are very clear statements of the end of the ego, as well as Jesus’ statement that he is no different from us. The First Coming of Christ is not the birth of Jesus, but rather is the creation of the Sonship of which he is a part. It was then that the ego’s dream appeared to be born, necessitating the Atonement correction. When the Atonement is complete and the Sonship awakens from the dream, the Second Coming of Christ dawns. And Jesus is asking us to join in that process with him, which he “undertook to begin” ([T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles)) (Wapnick, AVI, p.228)
:::

:::tip
(4) Jesus says he is in charge of the Atonement [T-1.III.1:1](/text/1-the-meaning-of-miracles/iii-atonement-and-miracles), and the teacher’s manual states that the Holy Spirit established Jesus as the leader of the plan of the Atonement ([C-6.2:2](/clarification/6-the-holy-spirit.html#p2)). The meaning here is the same. Moreover, again, his judgement clearly lacks the implication of punishment or attack that is central to the traditional view. Jesus’ judgement is simply that the separation never happened, and so our pain and suffering not only is not warranted, but is inherently nonexistent, its cause of sin having been undone. Thus we are ‘protected’ from the ego’s thought system by the truth of the Atonement. (Wapnick, AVI, p.228–229)

³The ego exerts maximal vigilance about what it permits into awareness, and this is not the way a balanced mind holds together.

The ego thinks some things can be bad. The ego is vigilant about what it allows to be aware of. The ego is not a balanced mind. The ego needs to keep its thought system out of awareness.

2. A major source of the ego’s off-balanced state is its lack of discrimination between the body and the Thoughts of God. 
²Thoughts of God are unacceptable to the ego, because they clearly point to the non-existence of the ego itself. 
³The ego therefore either distorts them or refuses to accept them. 
⁴It cannot, however, make them cease to be. 
⁵It therefore tries to conceal not only ‘unacceptable’ body impulses, but also the Thoughts of God, because both are threatening to it. 
⁶Being concerned primarily with its own preservation in the face of threat, the ego perceives them as the same. 
⁷By perceiving them as the same, the ego attempts to save itself from being swept away, as it would surely be in the presence of knowledge.

⁷Therefore, the mind asks, “Where can I go for protection?”, to which the ego replies, “Turn to me”. 
⁸The mind, and not without cause, reminds the ego that it has itself insisted that it is identified with the body, so there is no point in turning to <em>it</em> for protection. 
⁹The ego has no real answer to this because there is none, but it does have a typical solution. 
¹⁰It obliterates the question from the mind’s awareness.

#### simplified

The body is the ego’s chosen home. The ego hates the body because the body is vulnerable. The ego wants to hide your identity as being of God. The ego tells the mind that the mind is part of the body, but the body can’t protect the mind. The ego offers to protect the mind instead. The mind does not feel protected by the ego because the ego told the mind that the mind was part of the body in the first place. The ego pushes the uneasiness of feeling unprotected out of awareness.

(5–11) …this clever description of the final stage in the ego’s strategy of not having the Son remember what it is really up to. …[referring] to the body as a defence against fear  …[an] example of the ego’s ability to bring abou tthe Son’s amnesia …the ego attempts to convince the Son to trust it. And when the Son recognises the clearly paradoxical and contradictory advice the ego gives him, *and complains about it*, the ego responds by simply not responding. (Wapnick, AAC, p.50)

:::tip
(9–11) Once the thought that God created this world is accorded truth, the ego can safely rest. Whatever inconsistencies may from time to time appear within the consciousness of individuals are quickly disposed of, either by the ego’s “appeal to ‘mysteries’, insisting that you must accept the meaningless to save yourself” ([T-9.IV.4:7](/text/9-the-acceptance-of-the-atonement/iv-the-holy-spirits-plan-of-forgiveness#p4)), or by repression. Once pushed out of awareness, these inconsistent thoughts are no longer accessible to question and revision. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.571–572)

The separated self not only has forgotten its *decision* to be on its own, but has forgotten too what it had chosen *against*: the Holy Spirit’s thought system of the Atonement. All that remains within the Son of God’s awareness is his autonomous and individual self, which of course remains an illusion … Nonetheless, within his own deluded mind at least, the Son of God has now made his fantasy into reality, and within this delusion he exists as a separated entity. c/f [T-11.V.4:4–6](/text/11-god-or-the-ego/v-the-dynamics-of-the-ego#p4), [C-in.1:4](/clarification/introduction#p1) (Wapnick, AAC, p.87)

God creates being who have everything. God’s created beings want to share. Sharing gives increase and joy. Having, being and sharing all mean the same thing.

## T-4.VII.6

<p class=fip id=p6>
6. The Bible repeatedly states that you should praise God. 
²This hardly means that you should tell Him how wonderful He is. 
³He has no ego with which to accept such praise, and no perception with which to judge it. 
⁴But unless you take your part in the creation, His joy is not complete because yours is incomplete. 
⁵And this He does know. 
⁶He knows it in His Own Being and its experience of His Son’s experience. 
⁷The constant going out of His Love is blocked when His channels are closed, and He is lonely when the minds He created do not communicate fully with Him.

#### simplified

Praising God means to take your part in the creation. Taking your part in creation gives you joy. God knows if you do not take your part because God feels your lack of joy.

7. God has kept your Kingdom for you, but He cannot share His joy with you until you know it with your whole mind. 
²Revelation is not enough, because it is only communication <em>from</em> God. 
³God does not need revelation returned to Him, which would clearly be impossible, but He does want it brought to others. 
⁴This cannot be done with the actual revelation; its content cannot be expressed, because it is intensely personal to the mind that receives it. 
⁵It can, however, be returned by that mind to other minds, through the attitudes the knowledge from the revelation brings.

Your kingdom is kept by God for you until you know God’s joy. God will reveal himself to you. Use the knowledge you gain by that to have the right attitude to others.

## T-4.VII.8


8. God is praised whenever any mind learns to be wholly helpful. 
²This is impossible without being wholly harmless, because the two beliefs must co-exist. 
³The truly helpful are invulnerable, because they are not protecting their egos and so nothing can hurt them. 
⁴Their helpfulness is their praise of God, and He will return their praise of Him because they are like Him, and they can rejoice together. 
⁵God goes out to them and through them, and there is great joy throughout the Kingdom. 
⁶Every mind that is changed adds to this joy with its individual willingness to share in it. 
⁷The truly helpful are God’s miracle workers, whom I direct until we are all united in the joy of the Kingdom. 
⁸I will direct you to wherever you can be truly helpful, and to whoever can follow my guidance through you.

Being helpful and being harmless goes together. The truly helpful do not protect their ego and therefore can neither harm nor be harmed. The truly helpful praise God and rejoice with God. I will direct you to where you can be truly helpful. I will direct you to those who can follow my guidance through you.
