1.&emsp;The Bible says that you should go with a brother twice as far as he asks. 
<sup>2</sup>It certainly does not suggest that you set him back on his journey. 
<sup>3</sup>Devotion to a brother cannot set you back either. 
<sup>4</sup>It can lead only to mutual progress. 
<sup>5</sup>The result of genuine devotion is inspiration, a word which properly understood is the opposite of fatigue. 
<sup>6</sup>To be fatigued is to be dis-spirited, but to be inspired is to be in the spirit. 
<sup>7</sup>To be egocentric is to be dis-spirited, but to be Self-centered in the right sense is to be inspired or in spirit. 
<sup>8</sup>The truly inspired are enlightened and cannot abide in darkness.

2.&emsp;You can speak from the spirit or from the ego, as you choose. 
<sup>2</sup>If you speak from spirit you have chosen to “Be still and know that I am God”. 
<sup>3</sup>These words are inspired because they reflect knowledge. 
<sup>4</sup>If you speak from the ego you are disclaiming knowledge instead of affirming it, and are thus dis-spiriting yourself. 
<sup>5</sup>Do not embark on useless journeys, because they are indeed in vain. 
<sup>6</sup>The ego may desire them, but spirit cannot embark on them because it is forever unwilling to depart from its Foundation.

Speak from the spirit. “Be still and know that I am God”. That is knowledge. Speaking from the ego is a useless journey. 

## T-4.in.3

<p class=fip id=p3>
3.&emsp;The journey to the cross should be the last “useless journey”. 
<sup>2</sup>Do not dwell upon it, but dismiss it as accomplished. 
<sup>3</sup>If you can accept it as your own last useless journey, you are also free to join my resurrection. 
<sup>4</sup>Until you do so your life is indeed wasted. 
<sup>5</sup>It merely re-enacts the separation, the loss of power, the futile attempts of the ego at reparation, and finally the crucifixion of the body, or death. 
<sup>6</sup>Such repetitions are endless until they are voluntarily given up. 
<sup>7</sup>Do not make the pathetic error of “clinging to the old rugged cross”. 
<sup>8</sup>The only message of the crucifixion is that you can overcome the cross. 
<sup>9</sup>Until then you are free to crucify yourself as often as you choose. 
<sup>10</sup>This is not the gospel I intended to offer you. 
<sup>11</sup>We have another journey to undertake, and if you will read these lessons carefully they will help prepare you to undertake it.

The journey to the cross is the last useless journey. The journey to the cross has been accomplished. Join my resurrection instead. Don’t waste your life re-enacting the separation. You can overcome the cross by no longer crucifying yourself. Make these lessons your journey.
