1. A good teacher clarifies his own ideas and strengthens them by teaching them. 
²Teacher and pupil are alike in the learning process. 
³They are in the same order of learning, and unless they share their lessons conviction will be lacking. 
⁴A good teacher must believe in the ideas he teaches, but he must meet another condition: he must believe in the students to whom he offers the ideas.

2. Many stand guard over their ideas because they want to protect their thought systems as they are, and learning means change. 
²Change is always fearful to the separated, because they cannot conceive of it as a move towards healing the separation. 
³They always perceive it as a move toward further separation, because the separation was their first experience of change. 
⁴You believe that if you allow no change to enter into your ego you will find peace. 
⁵This profound confusion is possible only if you maintain that the same thought system can stand on two foundations. 
⁶Nothing can reach spirit from the ego, and nothing can reach the ego from spirit. 
⁷Spirit can neither strengthen the ego nor reduce the conflict within it. 
⁸The ego *is* a contradiction. 
⁹Your self and God’s Self *are* in opposition. 
¹⁰They are opposed in source, in direction and in outcome. 
¹¹They are fundamentally irreconcilable, because spirit cannot perceive and the ego cannot know. 
¹²They are therefore not in communication and can never be in communication. 
¹³Nevertheless, the ego can learn, even though its maker can be misguided. 
¹⁴He cannot, however, make the totally lifeless out of the life-given.

6. Egos can clash in any situation, but spirit cannot clash at all. 
²If you perceive a teacher as merely ‘a larger ego’ you will be afraid, because to enlarge an ego would be to increase anxiety about separation. 
³I will teach with you and live with you if you will think with me, but my goal will always be to absolve you finally from the need for a teacher. 
⁴This is the opposite of the ego-oriented teacher’s goal. 
⁵He is concerned with the effect of his ego on other egos, and therefore interprets their interaction as a means of ego preservation. 
⁶I would not be able to devote myself to teaching if I believed this, and you will not be a devoted teacher as long as you believe it. 
⁷I am constantly being perceived as a teacher either to be exalted or rejected, but I do not accept either perception for myself.
