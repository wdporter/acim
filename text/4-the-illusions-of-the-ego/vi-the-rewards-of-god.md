# T-4.VI The Rewards of God

1.&emsp;The ego does not recognise the real source of ‘threat’, and if you associate yourself with the ego, you do not understand the situation as it is. 
<sup>2</sup>Only your allegiance to it gives the ego any power over you. 
<sup>3</sup>I have spoken of the ego as if it were a separate thing, acting on its own. 
<sup>4</sup>This was necessary to persuade you that you cannot dismiss it lightly, and must realise how much of your thinking is ego-directed. 
<sup>5</sup>We cannot safely let it go at that, however, or you will regard yourself as necessarily conflicted as long as you are here, or as long as you believe that you are here. 
<sup>6</sup>The ego is nothing more than a part of your belief about yourself. 
<sup>7</sup>Your other life has continued without interruption, and has been and always will be totally unaffected by your attempts to dissociate it.

Do not associate yourself with the ego. It is not easy to dismiss the ego. The ego is not a separate thing. The ego is part of your belief about yourself.

(3–4, 6) …although we speak of the ego as if it functioned autonomously, having an existence independent from the Son, in reality of course the ego is ourselves, or at least what we experience to be ourselves. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 465)

(3–6) …the two halves of the split mind — the ego and the Holy Spirit — represent two different and mutually exclusive reactions to, or interpretations and experiences of the “tiny, mad idea”. They are anthropomorphised in *A Course in Miracles* for pedagogical reasons. [Here] Jesus explains his anthropomorphising the ego. (Wapnick, AAC, p.30)

2.&emsp;In learning to escape from illusions, your debt to your brother is something you must never forget. 
<sup>2</sup>It is the same debt that you owe to me. 
<sup>3</sup>Whenever you act egotistically towards another, you are throwing away the graciousness of your indebtedness and the holy perception it would produce. 
<sup>4</sup>The term ‘holy’ can be used here because, as you learn how much you are indebted to the whole Sonship, which includes me, you come as close to knowledge as perception can. 
<sup>5</sup>The gap is then so small that knowledge can easily flow across it and obliterate it forever.

When you learn to escape from illusions, you will owe a debt to me and to all your brothers. When you understand your indebtedness, you come close to knowledge.

3.&emsp;You have very little trust in me as yet, but it will increase as you turn more and more often to me instead of to your ego for guidance. 
<sup>2</sup>The results will convince you increasingly that this choice is the only sane one you can make. 
<sup>3</sup>No one who learns from experience that one choice brings peace and joy while another brings chaos and disaster needs additional convincing. 
<sup>4</sup>Learning through rewards is more effective than learning through pain, because pain is an ego illusion, and can never induce more than a temporary effect. 
<sup>5</sup>The rewards of God, however, are immediately recognised as eternal. 
<sup>6</sup>Since this recognition is made by you and not the ego, the recognition itself establishes that you and your ego cannot be identical. 
<sup>7</sup>You may believe that you have already accepted this difference, but you are by no means convinced as yet. 
<sup>8</sup>The fact that you believe you must escape from the ego shows this; but you cannot escape from the ego by humbling it or controlling it or punishing it.

The more you trust in me, the more you learn it is insane not to trust me. Trusting in me brings peace and joy. Trusting anywhere else brings chaos and disaster. The rewards of God are recognised by your true self. You do not escape from the ego by controlling the ego.

4.&emsp;The ego and the spirit do not know each other. 
<sup>2</sup>The separated mind cannot maintain the separation except by dissociating. 
<sup>3</sup>Having done this, it denies all truly natural impulses, not because the ego is a separate thing, but because you want to believe that <em>you</em> are. 
<sup>4</sup>The ego is a device for maintaining this belief, but it is still only your decision to use the device that enables it to endure.

You maintain the separated mind by disocciating from the spirit. The ego is what you use to maintain the belief that you are a separate thing. You make a decision to use the ego.

5.&emsp;How can you teach someone the value of something he has deliberately thrown away? 
<sup>2</sup>He must have thrown it away because he did not value it. 
<sup>3</sup>You can only show him how miserable he is without it, and slowly bring it nearer so he can learn how his misery lessens as he approaches it. 
<sup>4</sup>This teaches him to associate his misery with its absence, and the opposite of misery with its presence. 
<sup>5</sup>It gradually becomes desirable as he changes his mind about its worth. 
<sup>6</sup>I am teaching you to associate misery with the ego and joy with the spirit. 
<sup>7</sup>You have taught yourself the opposite. 
<sup>8</sup>You are still free to choose, but can you really want the rewards of the ego in the presence of the rewards of God?

You did not value spirit so you threw spirit away. Without spirit you are miserable. As you come closer to spirit, you are less miserable. Ego is joy. Your are free to choose between ego/misery and spirit/joy.

6.&emsp;My trust in you is greater than yours in me at the moment, but it will not always be that way. 
<sup>2</sup>Your mission is very simple. 
<sup>3</sup>You are asked to live so as to demonstrate that you are not an ego, and I do not choose God’s channels wrongly. 
<sup>4</sup>The Holy One shares my trust, and accepts my Atonement decisions because my will is never out of accord with His. 
<sup>5</sup>I have said before that I am in charge of the Atonement. 
<sup>6</sup>This is only because I completed my part in it as a man, and can now complete it through others. 
<sup>7</sup>My chosen channels cannot fail, because I will lend them my strength as long as theirs is wanting.
