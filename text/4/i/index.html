		2.&emsp;Many stand guard over their ideas because they want to protect their thought systems as they are, and learning means change. 
		<sup>2</sup>Change is always fearful to the separated, because they cannot conceive of it as a move towards healing the separation. 
		<sup>3</sup>They always perceive it as a move toward further separation, because the separation was their first experience of change. 
		<sup>4</sup>You believe that if you allow no change to enter into your ego you will find peace. 
		<sup>5</sup>This profound confusion is possible only if you maintain that the same thought system can stand on two foundations. 
		<sup>6</sup>Nothing can reach spirit from the ego, and nothing can reach the ego from spirit. 
		<sup>7</sup>Spirit can neither strengthen the ego nor reduce the conflict within it. 
		<sup>8</sup>The ego <em>is</em> a contradiction. 
		<sup>9</sup>Your self and God’s Self <em>are</em> in opposition. 
		<sup>10</sup>They are opposed in source, in direction and in outcome. 
		<sup>11</sup>They are fundamentally irreconcilable, because spirit cannot perceive and the ego cannot know. 
		<sup>12</sup>They are therefore not in communication and can never be in communication. 
		<sup>13</sup>Nevertheless, the ego can learn, even though its maker can be misguided. 
		<sup>14</sup>He cannot, however, make the totally lifeless out of the life-given.
