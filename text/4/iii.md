# T-4.III Love Without Conflict

## T-4.III.1

<p class=fip id=p1>
1.&emsp;It is hard to understand what “The Kingdom of Heaven is within you” really means. 
<sup>2</sup>This is because it is not understandable to the ego, which interprets it as if something outside is inside, and this does not mean anything. 
<sup>3</sup>The word ‘within’ is unnecessary. 
<sup>4</sup>The Kingdom of Heaven <em>is</em> you. 
<sup>5</sup>What else <em>but</em> you did the Creator create, and what else <em>but</em> you is His Kingdom? 
<sup>6</sup>This is the whole message of the Atonement; a message which in its totality transcends the sum of its parts. 
<sup>7</sup>You, too, have a Kingdom that your spirit created. 
<sup>8</sup>It has not ceased to create because of the ego’s illusions. 
<sup>9</sup>Your creations are no more fatherless than you are. 
<sup>10</sup>Your ego and your spirit will never be co-creators, but your spirit and your Creator will always be. 
<sup>11</sup>Be confident that your creations are as safe as you are.
<span class=course-quote><br>
<sup>12</sup>The Kingdom is perfectly united and perfectly protected, and the ego will not prevail against it. <br>
<sup>13</sup>Amen.<br>

#### simplified

The Kingdom of Heaven is you, because God created you. The kingdom you made is an illusion. Ego and spirit cannot co-create. Your spirit and God will always co-create.

		3.&emsp;It is surely apparent by now why the ego regards spirit as its ‘enemy’. 
		<sup>2</sup>The ego arose from the separation, and its continued existence depends on your continuing belief in the separation. 
		<sup>3</sup>The ego must offer you some sort of reward for maintaining this belief. 
		<sup>4</sup>All it can offer is a sense of temporary existence, which begins with its own beginning and ends with its own ending. 
		<sup>5</sup>It tells you this life is your existence because it is its own. 
		<sup>6</sup>Against this sense of temporary existence spirit offers you the knowledge of permanence and unshakable being. 
		<sup>7</sup>No one who has experienced the revelation of this can ever fully believe in the ego again. 
		<sup>8</sup>How can its meagre offering to you prevail against the glorious gift of God?

		4.&emsp;You who identify with your ego cannot believe God loves you.

		3 Being made out of the denial of the Father, the ego has no allegiance to its maker. 
		4 You cannot conceive of the real relationship that exists between God and His creations because of your hatred for the self you made. 
		5 You project onto the ego the decision to separate, and this conflicts with the love you feel for the ego because you made it. 
		6 No love in this world is without this ambivalence, and since no ego has experienced love without ambivalence the concept is beyond its understanding. 
		7 Love will enter immediately into any mind that truly wants it, but it must want it truly.
