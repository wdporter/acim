<p>1. For learning purposes, let us consider the crucifixion again. 
²I did not dwell on it before because of the fearful connotations you may associate with it. 
³The only emphasis laid upon it so far has been that it was not a form of punishment. 
⁴Nothing, however, can be explained in negative terms only. 
⁵There is a positive interpretation of the crucifixion that is wholly devoid of fear, and therefore wholly benign in what it teaches, if it is properly understood.

<p>2. The crucifixion is nothing more than an extreme example. 
²Its value, like the value of any teaching device, lies solely in the kind of learning it facilitates. 
³It can be, and has been, misunderstood. 
⁴This is only because the fearful are apt to perceive fearfully. 
⁵I have already told you that you can always call on me to share my decision, and thus make it stronger. 
⁶I have also told you that the crucifixion was the last useless journey the Sonship need take, and that it represents release from fear to anyone who understands it. 
⁷While I emphasised only the resurrection before, the purpose of the crucifixion and how it actually led to the resurrection was not clarified then. 
⁸Nevertheless, it has a definite contribution to make to your own life, and if you will consider it without fear, it will help you understand your own role as a teacher.

<p>3. You have probably reäcted for years as if you were being crucified. 
²This is a marked tendency of the separated, who always refuse to consider what they have done to themselves. 
³Projection means anger, anger fosters assault, and assault promotes fear. 
⁴The real meaning of the crucifixion lies in the <em>apparent</em> intensity of the assault of some of the Sons of God upon another. 
⁵This, of course, is impossible, and must be fully understood <em>as</em> impossible. 
⁶Otherwise, I cannot serve as a model for learning.

Projection creates anger and assault, which results in fear. 
The crucifixion represents an intense assault. 
But Sons of God cannot assault each other.

<p>4. Assault can ultimately be made only on the body. 
²There is little doubt that one body can assault another, and can even destroy it. 
³Yet if destruction itself is impossible, anything that is destructible cannot be real. 
⁴Its destruction, therefore, does not justify anger. 
⁵To the extent to which you believe that it does, you are accepting false premises and teaching them to others. 
⁶The message the crucifixion was intended to teach was that it is not necessary to perceive any form of assault in persecution, because you cannot <em>be</em> persecuted. 
⁷If you respond with anger, you must be equating yourself with the destructible, and are therefore regarding yourself insanely.

If something can be destroyed it is not real. 
The body can be destroyed so the body is not real. 
Do not respond with anger to any threat of destruction.
</details>

<details><summary>Note</summary>
Eastern tradition defines the Real as that which never changes. 
In Western philosophy, the Real is that which has necessary existence, as opposed to contingent existence. 
The Real exists by itself. 
If it can’t change, it can’t be threatened. 
The body is however contingent and subject to change, therefore by definition is not real.

<p>5. I have made it perfectly clear that I am like you and you are like me, but our fundamental equality can be demonstrated only through joint decision. 
²You are free to perceive yourself as persecuted if you choose. 
³When you do choose to reäct that way, however, you might remember that I was persecuted as the world judges, and did not share this evaluation for myself. 
⁴And because I did not share it, I did not strengthen it. 
⁵I therefore offered a different interpretation of attack, and one which I want to share with you. 
⁶If you will believe it, you will help me teach it.

³This is not a lesson a Son of God should want to teach if he is to realise his own salvation. 
⁴Rather, teach your own perfect immunity, which is the truth in you, and realise that it cannot <em>be</em> assailed. 
⁵Do not try to protect it yourself, or you are believing that it is assailable. 
⁶You are not asked to be crucified, which was part of my own teaching contribution. 
⁷You are merely asked to follow my example in the face of much less extreme temptations to misperceive, and not to accept them as false justifications for anger. 
⁸There can be no justification for the unjustifiable. 
⁹Do not believe there is, and do not teach that there is.

If you interpret the crucifixion in any other way [other than teaching love], you are using it [the crucifion] as a weapon for assault rather than as the call for peace for which it [the crucifixion] was intended. 
²The Apostles often misunderstood it [the crucifixion], and for the same reason that anyone misunderstands it [the crucifixion]. 
³Their [the-Apostles’] own imperfect love made them [the Apostles] vulnerable to projection, and out of their [the-Apostles’] own fear they [the Apostles] spoke of the ‘wrath of God’ as His [God’s] retaliatory weapon. 
⁴Nor could they [the Apostles] speak of the crucifixion entirely without anger, because their [the-Apostles’] sense of guilt had made them [the Apostles] angry.

²If the Apostles had not felt guilty, they never could have quoted me as saying, “I come not to bring peace but a sword”. 
³This is clearly the opposite of everything I taught. 
⁴Nor could they have described my reäctions to Judas as they did, if they had really understood me. 
⁵I could not have said, “Betray you the Son of man with a kiss?” unless I believed in betrayal. 
⁶The whole message of the crucifixion was simply that I did not. 
⁷The ‘punishment’ I was said to have called forth upon Judas was a similar mistake. 
⁸Judas was my brother and a Son of God, as much a part of the Sonship as myself. 
⁹Was it likely that I would condemn him when I was ready to demonstrate that condemnation is impossible?

<p>16. As you read the teachings of the Apostles, remember that I told them myself that there was much they would understand later, because they were not wholly ready to follow me at the time. 
²I do not want you to allow any fear to enter into the thought system toward which I am guiding you. 
³I do not call for martyrs but for teachers. 
⁴No one is punished for sins, and the Sons of God are not sinners. 
⁵Any concept of punishment involves the projection of blame, and reïnforces the idea that blame is justified. 
⁶The result is a lesson in blame, for all behaviour teaches the beliefs that motivate it. 
⁷The crucifixion was the result of clearly opposed thought systems; the perfect symbol of the ‘conflict’ between the ego and the Son of God. 
⁸This conflict seems just as real now, and its lessons must be learned now as well as then.
