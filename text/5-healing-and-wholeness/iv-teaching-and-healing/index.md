1. What fear has hidden still is part of you. 
²Joining the Atonement is the way out of fear. 
³The Holy Spirit will help you reïnterpret everything that you perceive as fearful, and teach you that only what is loving is true. 
⁴Truth is beyond your ability to destroy, but entirely within your ability to accept. 
⁵It belongs to you because, as an extension of God, you created it with Him. 
⁶It is yours because it is part of you, just as you are part of God because He created you. 
⁷Nothing that is good can be lost because it comes from the Holy Spirit, the Voice for creation. 
⁸Nothing that is not good was ever created, and therefore cannot be protected. 
⁹The Atonement is the guarantee of the safety of the Kingdom, and the union of the Sonship is its protection. 
¹⁰The ego cannot prevail against the Kingdom because the Sonship is united.
¹¹In the presence of those who hear the Holy Spirit’s Call to be as one, the ego fades away and is undone.

2. What the ego makes it keeps to itself, and so it is without strength. 
²Its existence is unshared. 
³It does not die; it was merely never born. 
⁴Physical birth is not a beginning; it is a continuing. 
⁵Everything that continues has already been born. 
⁶It will increase as you are willing to return the unhealed part of your mind to the higher part, returning it undivided to creation. 
⁷I have come to give you the foundation, so your own thoughts can make you really free. 
⁸You have carried the burden of unshared ideas that are too weak to increase, but having made them you did not realise how to undo them. 
⁹You cannot cancel out your past errors alone. 
¹⁰They will not disappear from your mind without the Atonement, a remedy not of your making. 
¹¹The Atonement must be understood as a pure act of sharing. 
¹²That is what I meant when I said it is possible even in this world to listen to one Voice. 
¹³If you are part of God and the Sonship is One, you cannot be limited to the self the ego sees.

Then you can share your real ideas with the Sonship.

(4–6) “Real birth is not a beginning; it is a *continuing*. Everything that *can* continue has already *been* born. But it can *increase* as you are willing to return the part of your mind that needs healing to the higher part, and thus render your creating (creation) undivided.” — from the Ur-text

3. Every loving thought held in any part of the Sonship belongs to every part. 
²It is shared *because* it is loving. 
³Sharing is God’s way of creating, and also yours. 
⁴The ego can keep you in exile from the Kingdom, but in the Kingdom itself it has no power. 
⁵Ideas of the spirit do not leave the mind that thinks them, nor can they conflict with each other. 
⁶However, ideas of the ego can conflict because they occur at different levels and also include opposite thoughts at the same level. 
⁷*It is impossible to share opposing thoughts*. 
⁸You can share only the thoughts that are of God and that He keeps for you. 
⁹And of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. 
¹⁰The rest remains with you until the Holy Spirit has reïnterpreted them in the light of the Kingdom, making them, too, worthy of being shared. 
¹¹When they have been sufficiently purified He lets you give them away. 
¹²The decision to share them *is* their purification.

The thoughts that oppose God can be shared after they have been reïnterpreted by the Holy Spirit.

4. I heard one Voice because I understood that I could not atone for myself alone. 
²Listening to one Voice implies the decision to share It in order to hear It yourself. 
³The Mind that was in me is still irresistibly drawn to every mind created by God, because God’s Wholeness is the Wholeness of His Son. 
⁴You cannot be hurt, and do not want to show your brother anything except your wholeness. 
⁵Show him that he cannot hurt you and hold nothing against him, or you hold it against yourself. 
⁶This is the meaning of “turning the other cheek”.

5. Teaching is done in many ways, above all by example. 
²Teaching should be healing, because it is the sharing of ideas and the recognition that to share ideas is to strengthen them. 
³I cannot forget my need to teach what I have learned, which arose in me *because* I learned it. 
⁴I call upon you to teach what you have learned, because by so doing you can depend on it. 
⁵Make it dependable in my name because my name is the Name of God’s Son. 
⁶What I learned I give you freely, and the Mind that was in me rejoices as you choose to hear it.

6. The Holy Spirit atones in all of us by undoing, and thus lifts the burden you have placed in your mind. 
²By following Him you are led back to God where you belong, and how can you find the way except by taking your brother with you? 
³My part in the Atonement is not complete until you join it and give it away. 
⁴As you teach so shall you learn. 
⁵I will never leave you or forsake you, because to forsake you would be to forsake myself and God Who created me. 
⁶You forsake yourself and God if you forsake any of your brothers. 
⁷You must learn to see them as they are, and understand they belong to God as you do. 
⁸How could you treat your brother better than by rendering unto God the things that are God’s?

7. The Atonement gives you the power of a healed mind, but the power to create is of God. 
²Therefore, those who have been forgiven must devote themselves first to healing because, having received the idea of healing, they must give it to hold it. 
³The full power of creation cannot be expressed as long as any of God’s ideas is withheld from the Kingdom. 
⁴The joint will of the Sonship is the only creator that can create like the Father, because only the complete can think completely, and the thinking of God lacks nothing. 
⁵Everything you think that is not through the Holy Spirit *is* lacking.
