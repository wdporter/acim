# T-5.I The Invitation To The Holy Spirit

## T-5.I.1

<p id=p1 class=fip>
1.&emsp;Healing is a thought by which two minds perceive their oneness and become glad. 
<sup>2</sup>This gladness calls to every part of the Sonship to rejoice with them, and lets God go out into them and through them. 
<sup>3</sup>Only the healed mind can experience revelation with lasting effect, because revelation is an experience of pure joy. 
<sup>4</sup>If you do not choose to be wholly joyous, your mind cannot have what it does not choose to be. 
<sup>5</sup>Remember that spirit knows no difference between <em>having</em> and <em>being</em>. 
<sup>6</sup>The higher mind thinks according to the laws spirit obeys, and therefore honours only the laws of God. 
<sup>7</sup>To spirit getting is meaningless and giving is all. 
<sup>8</sup>Having everything, spirit holds everything by giving it, and thus creates as the Father created. 
<sup>9</sup>While this kind of thinking is totally alien to having things, even to the lower mind it is quite comprehensible in connection with ideas. 
<sup>10</sup>If you share a physical possession, you do divide its ownership. 
<sup>11</sup>If you share an idea, however, you do not lessen it. 
<sup>12</sup>All of it is still yours although all of it has been given away. 
<sup>13</sup>Further, if the one to whom you give it accepts it as his, he reïnforces it in your mind and thus increases it. 
<sup>14</sup>If you can accept the concept that the world is one of ideas, the whole belief in the false association the ego makes between giving and losing is gone.

1.&emsp;Healing is a thought by which [thought] two minds perceive their [two-mind’s] oneness and become glad. 
<sup>2</sup>This gladness [of perceiving oneness] calls to every part of the Sonship to rejoice with them [the two minds], and lets God go out into them [the two minds ] and through them [the two minds]. 
<sup>3</sup>Only the healed mind can experience revelation with lasting effect, because revelation is an experience of pure joy. 
<sup>4</sup>If you do not choose to be wholly joyous, your mind cannot have what it [your mind] does not choose to be.

<sup>8</sup>Having everything, spirit holds everything by giving it [everything], and thus creates as the Father created. 
<sup>9</sup>While this kind of thinking [holding by giving] is totally alien to having things, even to the lower mind it [thinking holding is giving] is quite comprehensible in connection with ideas. 
<sup>10</sup>If you share a physical possession, you do divide its [a-physical-possession’s] ownership. 
<sup>11</sup>If you share an idea, however, you do not lessen it [the idea].

<sup>13</sup>Further, if the one to whom you give it [the idea] accepts it [the idea] as his [the-receiver-of-the-idea’s], he [the receiver] reïnforces it [the idea] in your mind and thus increases it [the idea]. 
<sup>14</sup>If you can accept the concept that the world is one [a world] of ideas, the whole belief in the false association the ego makes between giving and losing is gone.

When two minds perceive their oneness they become glad and are healed. Everything is an idea. Ideas increase when shared.

<span class=course-quote><sup>2</sup>Thoughts increase by being given away. <br>
<sup>3</sup>The more who believe in them the stronger they become. <br>
<sup>4</sup>Everything is an idea. <br>
<sup>5</sup>How, then, can giving and losing be associated?</span>

## T-5.I.4

<p id=p4 class=fip>
4.&emsp;The Holy Spirit is the only part of the Holy Trinity that has a symbolic function. 
<sup>2</sup>He is referred to as the Healer, the Comforter and the Guide. 
<sup>3</sup>He is also described as something ‘separate’, apart from the Father and from the Son. 
<sup>4</sup>I myself said, “If I go I will send you another Comforter and he will abide with you”. 
<sup>5</sup>His symbolic function makes the Holy Spirit difficult to understand, because symbolism is open to different interpretations. 
<sup>6</sup>As a man and also one of God’s creations, my right thinking, which came from the Holy Spirit or the Universal Inspiration, taught me first and foremost that this Inspiration is for all. 
<sup>7</sup>I could not have It myself without knowing this. 
<sup>8</sup>The word ‘know’ is proper in this context, because the Holy Spirit is so close to knowledge that He calls it forth; or better, allows it to come. 
<sup>9</sup>I have spoken before of the higher or ‘true’ perception, which is so near to truth that God Himself can flow across the little gap. 
<sup>10</sup>Knowledge is always ready to flow everywhere, but it cannot oppose. 
<sup>11</sup>Therefore you can obstruct it, although you can never lose it.

5.&emsp;The Holy Spirit is the Christ Mind which is aware of the knowledge that lies beyond perception. 
<sup>2</sup>He came into being with the separation as a protection, inspiring the Atonement principle at the same time. 
<sup>3</sup>Before that there was no need for healing, for no one was comfortless. 
<sup>4</sup>The Voice of the Holy Spirit is the Call to Atonement, or the restoration of the integrity of the mind. 
<sup>5</sup>When the Atonement is complete and the whole Sonship is healed there will be no Call to return. 
<sup>6</sup>But what God creates is eternal. 
<sup>7</sup>The Holy Spirit will remain with the Sons of God, to bless their creations and keep them in the light of joy.

1.&emsp;Healing is not creating; it is reparation. 
<sup>2</sup>The Holy Spirit promotes healing by looking beyond it to what the children of God were before healing was needed, and will be when they have been healed. 
<sup>3</sup>This alteration of the time sequence should be quite familiar, because it is very similar to the shift in the perception of time that the miracle introduces. 
<sup>4</sup>The Holy Spirit is the motivation for miracle-mindedness; the decision to heal the separation by letting it go. 
<sup>5</sup>Your will is still in you because God placed it in your mind, and although you can keep it asleep you cannot obliterate it. 
<sup>6</sup>God Himself keeps your will alive by transmitting it from His Mind to yours as long as there is time. 
<sup>7</sup>The miracle itself is a reflection of this union of Will between Father and Son.

<sup>6</sup>The idea of the Holy Spirit is strengthened by being given away. 
<sup>7</sup>The idea of the Holy Spirit increases in you as you give the idea of the Holy Spirit to your brother. 
<sup>8</sup>Your brother does not have to be aware of the Holy Spirit in your-brother’s-self, or be aware of the Holy Spirit in you, for the miracle of the Holy Spirit increasing to occur. 
<sup>9</sup>Your brother may have dissociated the Call for God, just as you have dissociated the Call for God. 
<sup>10</sup>The dissociation of the Call for God, is healed in both of you, as you become aware of the Call for God in your brother, and thus acknowledge the-Call-for-God’s being.

### simplified

The Holy Spirit is the Call for God. The Call for God is an idea. Ideas gain when they are shared. When you recognise the Call for God in your brother, you recognise the existence of the Call for God.

<p>T-5.III.4. The Voice of the Holy Spirit is weak in you. 2 That is why you must share It. ³ It must be increased in strength before you can hear It. 4 It is impossible to hear It in yourself while It is so weak in your mind. 5 It is not weak in Itself, but It is limited by your unwillingness to hear It. 6 If you make the mistake of looking for the Holy Spirit in yourself alone your thoughts will frighten you because, by adopting the ego's viewpoint, you are undertaking an ego-alien journey with the ego as guide. 7 This is bound to produce fear.</p><p>T-5.III.5. Delay is of the ego, because time is its concept. 2 Both time and delay are meaningless in eternity. ³ I have said before that the Holy Spirit is God's Answer to the ego. 4 Everything of which the Holy Spirit reminds you is in direct opposition to the ego's notions, because true and false perceptions are themselves opposed. 5 The Holy Spirit has the task of undoing what the ego has made. 6 He undoes it at the same level on which the ego operates, or the mind would be unable to understand the change.</p><p>T-5.III.6. I have repeatedly emphasized that one level of the mind is not understandable to another. 2 So it is with the ego and the Holy Spirit; with time and eternity. ³ Eternity is an idea of God, so the Holy Spirit understands it perfectly. 4 Time is a belief of the ego, so the lower mind, which is the ego's domain, accepts it without question. 5 The only aspect of time that is eternal is <i> now</i>.</p><p>T-5.III.7. The Holy Spirit is the Mediator between the interpretations of the ego and the knowledge of the spirit. 2 His ability to deal with symbols enables Him to work with the ego's beliefs in its own language. ³ His ability to look beyond symbols into eternity enables Him to understand the laws of God, for which He speaks. 4 He can therefore perform the function of reinterpreting what the ego makes, not by destruction but by understanding. 5 Understanding is light, and light leads to knowledge. 6 The Holy Spirit is in light because He is in you who are light, but you yourself do not know this. 7 It is therefore the task of the Holy Spirit to reinterpret you on behalf of God.</p><p>T-5.III.8. You cannot understand yourself alone. 2 This is because you have no meaning apart from your rightful place in the Sonship, and the rightful place of the Sonship is God. ³ This is your life, your eternity and your Self. 4 It is of this that the Holy Spirit reminds you. 5 It is this that the Holy Spirit sees. 6 This vision frightens the ego because it is so calm. 7 Peace is the ego's greatest enemy because, according to its interpretation of reality, war is the guarantee of its survival. 8 The ego becomes strong in strife. 9 If you believe there is strife you will react viciously, because the idea of danger has entered your mind. 10 The idea itself is an appeal to the ego. 11 The Holy Spirit is as vigilant as the ego to the call of danger, opposing it with His strength just as the ego welcomes it. 12 The Holy Spirit counters this welcome by welcoming peace. 13 Eternity and peace are as closely related as are time and war.</p><p>T-5.III.9. Perception derives meaning from relationships. 2 Those you accept are the foundations of your beliefs. ³ The separation is merely another term for a split mind. 4 The ego is the symbol of separation, just as the Holy Spirit is the symbol of peace. 5 What you perceive in others you are strengthening in yourself. 6 You may let your mind misperceive, but the Holy Spirit lets your mind reinterpret its own misperceptions.</p><p>T-5.III.10. The Holy Spirit is the perfect Teacher. 2 He uses only what your mind already understands to teach you that you do not understand it. ³ The Holy Spirit can deal with a reluctant learner without going counter to his mind, because part of it is still for God. 4 Despite the ego's attempts to conceal this part, it is still much stronger than the ego, although the ego does not recognize it. 5 The Holy Spirit recognizes it perfectly because it is His Own dwelling place; the place in the mind where He is at home. 6 You are at home there, too, because it is a place of peace, and peace is of God. 7 You who are part of God are not at home except in His peace. 8 If peace is eternal, you are at home only in eternity.</p><p>T-5.III.11. The ego made the world as it perceives it, but the Holy Spirit, the reinterpreter of what the ego made, sees the world as a teaching device for bringing you home. 2 The Holy Spirit must perceive time, and reinterpret it into the timeless. ³ He must work through opposites, because He must work with and for a mind that is in opposition. 4 Correct and learn, and be open to learning. 5 You have not made truth, but truth can still set you free. 6 Look as the Holy Spirit looks, and understand as He understands. 7 His understanding looks back to God in remembrance of me. 8 He is in communion with God always, and He is part of you. 9 He is your Guide to salvation, because He holds the remembrance of things past and to come, and brings them to the present. 10 He holds this gladness gently in your mind, asking only that you increase it in His Name by sharing it to increase His joy in you.</p># T-5.in Introduction

<sup>2</sup>This gladness calls to every part of the Sonship to rejoice with them, and lets God go out into them and through them.

<sup>4</sup>If you do not choose to be wholly joyous, your mind cannot have what it does not choose to be. 
<sup>5</sup>Remember that spirit knows no difference between <em>having</em> and <em>being</em>. 
<sup>6</sup>The higher mind thinks according to the laws spirit obeys, and therefore honours only the laws of God. 
<sup>7</sup>To spirit getting is meaningless and giving is all. 
<sup>8</sup>Having everything, spirit holds everything by giving it, and thus creates as the Father created. 
<sup>9</sup>While this kind of thinking is totally alien to having things, even to the lower mind it is quite comprehensible in connection with ideas. 
<sup>10</sup>If you share a physical possession, you do divide its ownership. 
<sup>11</sup>If you share an idea, however, you do not lessen it. 
<sup>12</sup>All of it is still yours although all of it has been given away. 
<sup>13</sup>Further, if the one to whom you give it accepts it as his, he reïnforces it in your mind and thus increases it. 
<sup>14</sup>If you can accept the concept that the world is one of ideas, the whole belief in the false association the ego makes between giving and losing is gone.

<sup>4</sup>I myself said, “If I go I will send you another Comforter and he will abide with you”. 
<sup>5</sup>His symbolic function makes the Holy Spirit difficult to understand, because symbolism is open to different interpretations. 
<sup>6</sup>As a man and also one of God’s creations, my right thinking, which came from the Holy Spirit or the Universal Inspiration, taught me first and foremost that this Inspiration is for all. 
<sup>7</sup>I could not have It myself without knowing this. 
<sup>8</sup>The word ‘know’ is proper in this context, because the Holy Spirit is so close to knowledge that He calls it forth; or better, allows it to come. 
<sup>9</sup>I have spoken before of the higher or ‘true’ perception, which is so near to truth that God Himself can flow across the little gap. 
<sup>10</sup>Knowledge is always ready to flow everywhere, but it cannot oppose. 
<sup>11</sup>Therefore you can obstruct it, although you can never lose it.

<sup>3</sup>Before the separation there was no need for healing, for no one was comfortless. 
<sup>4</sup>The Voice of the Holy Spirit is the Call to Atonement, or the restoration of the integrity of the mind. 
<sup>5</sup>When the Atonement is complete and the whole Sonship is healed there will be no Call to return. 
<sup>6</sup>But what God creates is eternal. 
<sup>7</sup>The Holy Spirit will remain with the Sons of God, to bless the-Sons-of-God’s creations and keep the Sons of God in the light of joy.

#### simplified

The Holy Spirit is the Christ Mind. The Christ Mind is aware there is knowledge beyond perception. When the separation occurred, the Holy Spirit came into being. The Holy Spirit brings comfort and healing, and inspires the Atonement.

<p>T-5.III.4. The Voice of the Holy Spirit is weak in you. 2 That is why you must share It. ³ It must be increased in strength before you can hear It. 4 It is impossible to hear It in yourself while It is so weak in your mind. 5 It is not weak in Itself, but It is limited by your unwillingness to hear It. 6 If you make the mistake of looking for the Holy Spirit in yourself alone your thoughts will frighten you because, by adopting the ego's viewpoint, you are undertaking an ego-alien journey with the ego as guide. 7 This is bound to produce fear.</p><p>T-5.III.5. Delay is of the ego, because time is its concept. 2 Both time and delay are meaningless in eternity. ³ I have said before that the Holy Spirit is God's Answer to the ego. 4 Everything of which the Holy Spirit reminds you is in direct opposition to the ego's notions, because true and false perceptions are themselves opposed. 5 The Holy Spirit has the task of undoing what the ego has made. 6 He undoes it at the same level on which the ego operates, or the mind would be unable to understand the change.</p><p>T-5.III.6. I have repeatedly emphasized that one level of the mind is not understandable to another. 2 So it is with the ego and the Holy Spirit; with time and eternity. ³ Eternity is an idea of God, so the Holy Spirit understands it perfectly. 4 Time is a belief of the ego, so the lower mind, which is the ego's domain, accepts it without question. 5 The only aspect of time that is eternal is <i> now</i>.</p><p>T-5.III.7. The Holy Spirit is the Mediator between the interpretations of the ego and the knowledge of the spirit. 2 His ability to deal with symbols enables Him to work with the ego's beliefs in its own language. ³ His ability to look beyond symbols into eternity enables Him to understand the laws of God, for which He speaks. 4 He can therefore perform the function of reinterpreting what the ego makes, not by destruction but by understanding. 5 Understanding is light, and light leads to knowledge. 6 The Holy Spirit is in light because He is in you who are light, but you yourself do not know this. 7 It is therefore the task of the Holy Spirit to reinterpret you on behalf of God.</p><p>T-5.III.8. You cannot understand yourself alone. 2 This is because you have no meaning apart from your rightful place in the Sonship, and the rightful place of the Sonship is God. ³ This is your life, your eternity and your Self. 4 It is of this that the Holy Spirit reminds you. 5 It is this that the Holy Spirit sees. 6 This vision frightens the ego because it is so calm. 7 Peace is the ego's greatest enemy because, according to its interpretation of reality, war is the guarantee of its survival. 8 The ego becomes strong in strife. 9 If you believe there is strife you will react viciously, because the idea of danger has entered your mind. 10 The idea itself is an appeal to the ego. 11 The Holy Spirit is as vigilant as the ego to the call of danger, opposing it with His strength just as the ego welcomes it. 12 The Holy Spirit counters this welcome by welcoming peace. 13 Eternity and peace are as closely related as are time and war.</p><p>T-5.III.9. Perception derives meaning from relationships. 2 Those you accept are the foundations of your beliefs. ³ The separation is merely another term for a split mind. 4 The ego is the symbol of separation, just as the Holy Spirit is the symbol of peace. 5 What you perceive in others you are strengthening in yourself. 6 You may let your mind misperceive, but the Holy Spirit lets your mind reinterpret its own misperceptions.</p><p>T-5.III.10. The Holy Spirit is the perfect Teacher. 2 He uses only what your mind already understands to teach you that you do not understand it. ³ The Holy Spirit can deal with a reluctant learner without going counter to his mind, because part of it is still for God. 4 Despite the ego's attempts to conceal this part, it is still much stronger than the ego, although the ego does not recognize it. 5 The Holy Spirit recognizes it perfectly because it is His Own dwelling place; the place in the mind where He is at home. 6 You are at home there, too, because it is a place of peace, and peace is of God. 7 You who are part of God are not at home except in His peace. 8 If peace is eternal, you are at home only in eternity.</p><p>T-5.III.11. The ego made the world as it perceives it, but the Holy Spirit, the reinterpreter of what the ego made, sees the world as a teaching device for bringing you home. 2 The Holy Spirit must perceive time, and reinterpret it into the timeless. ³ He must work through opposites, because He must work with and for a mind that is in opposition. 4 Correct and learn, and be open to learning. 5 You have not made truth, but truth can still set you free. 6 Look as the Holy Spirit looks, and understand as He understands. 7 His understanding looks back to God in remembrance of me. 8 He is in communion with God always, and He is part of you. 9 He is your Guide to salvation, because He holds the remembrance of things past and to come, and brings them to the present. 10 He holds this gladness gently in your mind, asking only that you increase it in His Name by sharing it to increase His joy in you.</p># T-5.in Introduction
