1. Do you really believe you can make a voice that can drown out God’s? 
²Do you really believe you can devise a thought system that can separate you from Him? 
³Do you really believe you can plan for your safety and joy better than He can? 
⁴You need be neither careful nor careless; you need merely cast your cares upon Him because He cares for you. 
⁵You are His care because He loves you. 
⁶His Voice reminds you always that all hope is yours because of His care. 
⁷You cannot choose to escape His care because that is not His Will, but you can choose to accept His care and use the infinite power of His care for all those He created by it.

2. There have been many healers who did not heal themselves. 
²They have not moved mountains by their faith because their faith was not whole. 
³Some of them have healed the sick at times, but they have not raised the dead. 
⁴Unless the healer heals himself, he cannot believe that there is no order of difficulty in miracles. 
⁵He has not learned that every mind God created is equally worthy of being healed *because* God created it whole. 
⁶You are merely asked to return to God the mind as He created it. 
⁷He asks you only for what He gave, knowing that this giving will heal you. 
⁸Sanity is wholeness, and the sanity of your brothers is yours.

3. Why should you listen to the endless insane calls you think are made upon you, when you can know the Voice for God is in you? 
²God commended His Spirit to you, and asks that you commend yours to Him. 
³He wills to keep it in perfect peace, because you are of one mind and spirit with Him. 
⁴Excluding yourself from the Atonement is the ego’s last-ditch defence of its own existence. 
⁵It reflects both the ego’s need to separate, and your willingness to side with its separateness. 
⁶This willingness means that you do not want to be healed.

5. Whenever you are not wholly joyous, it is because you have reäcted with a lack of love to one of God’s creations. 
²Perceiving this as ‘sin’ you become defensive because you expect attack. 
³The decision to reäct in this way is yours, and can therefore be undone. 
⁴It cannot be undone by repentance in the usual sense, because this implies guilt. 
⁵If you allow yourself to feel guilty, you will reïnforce the error rather than allow it to be undone for you.

6. Decision cannot be difficult. 
²This is obvious, if you realise that you must already have decided not to be wholly joyous if that is how you feel. 
³Therefore, the first step in the undoing is to recognise that you actively decided wrongly, but can as actively decide otherwise. 
⁴Be very firm with yourself in this, and keep yourself fully aware that the undoing process, which does not come from you, is nevertheless within you because God placed it there. 
⁵Your part is merely to return your thinking to the point at which the error was made, and give it over to the Atonement in peace. 
⁶Say this to yourself as sincerely as you can, remembering that the Holy Spirit will respond fully to your slightest invitation: 
>⁷I must have decided wrongly, because I am not at peace.  
⁸I made the decision myself, but I can also decide otherwise.  
⁹I want to decide otherwise, because I want to be at peace.  
¹⁰I do not feel guilty, because the Holy Spirit will undo all the consequences of my wrong decision if I will let Him.  
¹¹I choose to let Him, by allowing Him to decide for God for me.
