1.â€ƒGod in His knowledge is not waiting, but His Kingdom is bereft while *you* wait. 
2 All the Sons of God are waiting for your return, just as you are waiting for theirs. 
3 Delay does not matter in eternity, but it is tragic in time. 
4 You have elected to be in time rather than eternity, and therefore believe you *are* in time. 
5 Yet your election is both free and alterable. 
6 You do not belong in time. 
7 Your place is only in eternity, where God Himself placed you forever.



</p><p>T-5.VI.2. Guilt feelings are the preservers of time. 2 They induce fears of retaliation or abandonment, and thus ensure that the future will be like the past. 3 This is the ego's continuity. 4 It gives the ego a false sense of security by believing that you cannot escape from it. 5 But you can and must. 6 God offers you the continuity of eternity in exchange. 7 When you choose to make this exchange, you will simultaneously exchange guilt for joy, viciousness for love, and pain for peace. 8 My role is only to unchain your will and set it free. 9 Your ego cannot accept this freedom, and will oppose it at every possible moment and in every possible way. 10 And as its maker, you recognize what it can do because you gave it the power to do it.</p><p>T-5.VI.3. Remember the Kingdom always, and remember that you who are part of the Kingdom cannot be lost. 2 The Mind that was in me <i> is </i> in you, for God creates with perfect fairness. 3 Let the Holy Spirit remind you always of His fairness, and let me teach you how to share it with your brothers. 4 How else can the chance to claim it for yourself be given you? 5 The two voices speak for different interpretations of the same thing simultaneously; or almost simultaneously, for the ego always speaks first. 6 Alternate interpretations were unnecessary until the first one was made.</p><p>T-5.VI.4. The ego speaks in judgment, and the Holy Spirit reverses its decision, much as a higher court has the power to reverse a lower court's decisions in this world. 2 The ego's decisions are always wrong, because they are based on the error they were made to uphold. 3 Nothing the ego perceives is interpreted correctly. 4 Not only does the ego cite Scripture for its purpose, but it even interprets Scripture as a witness for itself. 5 The Bible is a fearful thing in the ego's judgment. 6 Perceiving it as frightening, it interprets it fearfully. 7 Being afraid, you do not appeal to the Higher Court because you believe its judgment would also be against you.</p><p>T-5.VI.5. There are many examples of how the ego's interpretations are misleading, but a few will suffice to show how the Holy Spirit can reinterpret them in His Own light.</p><p>T-5.VI.6. "As ye sow, so shall ye reap" He interprets to mean what you consider worth cultivating you will cultivate in yourself. 2 Your judgment of what is worthy makes it worthy for you.</p><p>T-5.VI.7. "Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord" is easily reinterpreted if you remember that ideas increase only by being shared. 2 The statement emphasizes that vengeance cannot be shared. 3 Give it therefore to the Holy Spirit, Who will undo it in you because it does not belong in your mind, which is part of God.</p><p>T-5.VI.8. "I will visit the sins of the fathers unto the third and fourth generation," as interpreted by the ego, is particularly vicious. 2 It becomes merely an attempt to guarantee the ego's own survival. 3 To the Holy Spirit, the statement means that in later generations He can still reinterpret what former generations had misunderstood, and thus release the thoughts from the ability to produce fear.</p><p>T-5.VI.9. "The wicked shall perish" becomes a statement of Atonement, if the word "perish" is understood as "be undone." 2 Every loveless thought must be undone, a word the ego cannot even understand. 3 To the ego, to be undone means to be destroyed. 4 The ego will not be destroyed because it is part of your thought, but because it is uncreative and therefore unsharing, it will be reinterpreted to release you from fear. 5 The part of your mind that you have given to the ego will merely return to the Kingdom, where your whole mind belongs. 6 You can delay the completion of the Kingdom, but you cannot introduce the concept of fear into it.</p><p>T-5.VI.10. You need not fear the Higher Court will condemn you. 2 It will merely dismiss the case against you. 3 There can be no case against a child of God, and every witness to guilt in God's creations is bearing false witness to God Himself. 4 Appeal everything you believe gladly to God's Own Higher Court, because it speaks for Him and therefore speaks truly. 5 It will dismiss the case against you, however carefully you have built it up. 6 The case may be fool-proof, but it is not God-proof. 7 The Holy Spirit will not hear it, because He can only witness truly. 8 His verdict will always be "thine is the Kingdom," because He was given to you to remind you of what you are.</p><p>T-5.VI.11. When I said "I am come as a light into the world," I meant that I came to share the light with you. 2 Remember my reference to the ego's dark glass, and remember also that I said, "Do not look there." 3 It is still true that where you look to find yourself is up to you. 4 Your patience with your brother is your patience with yourself. 5 Is not a child of God worth patience? 6 I have shown you infinite patience because my will is that of our Father, from Whom I learned of infinite patience. 7 His Voice was in me as It is in you, speaking for patience towards the Sonship in the Name of its Creator.</p><p>T-5.VI.12. Now you must learn that only infinite patience produces immediate effects. 2 This is the way in which time is exchanged for eternity. 3 Infinite patience calls upon infinite love, and by producing results <i> now </i> it renders time unnecessary. 4 We have repeatedly said that time is a learning device to be abolished when it is no longer useful. 5 The Holy Spirit, Who speaks for God in time, also knows that time is meaningless. 6 He reminds you of this in every passing moment of time, because it is His special function to return you to eternity and remain to bless your creations there. 7 He is the only blessing you can truly give, because He is truly blessed. 8 Because He has been given you freely by God, you must give Him as you received Him.
