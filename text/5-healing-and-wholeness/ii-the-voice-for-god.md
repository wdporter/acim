1.&emsp;Healing is not creating; it is reparation. 
<sup>2</sup>The Holy Spirit promotes healing by looking beyond it to what the children of God were before healing was needed, and will be when they have been healed. 
<sup>3</sup>This alteration of the time sequence should be quite familiar, because it is very similar to the shift in the perception of time that the miracle introduces. 
<sup>4</sup>The Holy Spirit is the motivation for miracle-mindedness; the decision to heal the separation by letting it go. 
<sup>5</sup>Your will is still in you because God placed it in your mind, and although you can keep it asleep you cannot obliterate it. 
<sup>6</sup>God Himself keeps your will alive by transmitting it from His Mind to yours as long as there is time. 
<sup>7</sup>The miracle itself is a reflection of this union of Will between Father and Son.

<sup>3</sup>This is the vocation of the mind. 
<sup>4</sup>The mind had no calling until the separation, because before that it had only being, and would not have understood the Call to right thinking.

<p class=fip id=p3>
3.&emsp;The principle of Atonement and the separation began at the same time. 
<sup>2</sup>When the ego was made, God placed in the mind the Call to joy. 
<sup>3</sup>This Call is so strong that the ego always dissolves at Its sound. 
<sup>4</sup>That is why you must choose to hear one of two voices within you. 
<sup>5</sup>One you made yourself, and that one is not of God. 
<sup>6</sup>But the other is given you by God, Who asks you only to listen to it. 
<sup>7</sup>The Holy Spirit is in you in a very literal sense. 
<sup>8</sup>His is the Voice that calls you back to where you were before and will be again. 
<sup>9</sup>It is possible even in this world to hear only that Voice and no other. 
<sup>10</sup>It takes effort and great willingness to learn. 
<sup>11</sup>It is the final lesson that I learned, and God’s Sons are as equal as learners as they are as sons.

5.&emsp;God does not guide, because He can share only perfect knowledge.

<sup>3</sup>By choosing one you give up the other. 
<sup>4</sup>The choice for the Holy Spirit is the choice for God. 
<sup>5</sup>God is not in you in a literal sense: you are part of Him.

6. The Holy Spirit calls you both to remember and to forget. 
<sup>2</sup>You have chosen to be in a state of opposition in which opposites are possible. 
<sup>3</sup>As a result, there are choices you must make. 
<sup>4</sup>In the holy state the will is free, so that its creative power is unlimited and choice is meaningless. 
<sup>5</sup>Freedom to choose is the same power as freedom to create, but its application is different. 
<sup>6</sup>Choosing depends on a split mind. 
<sup>7</sup>The Holy Spirit is one way of choosing. 
<sup>8</sup>God did not leave His children comfortless, even though they chose to leave Him. 
<sup>9</sup>The voice they put in their minds was not the Voice for His Will, for which the Holy Spirit speaks.

12.&emsp;I have enjoined you to behave as I behaved, but we must respond to the same Mind to do this. 
<sup>2</sup>This Mind is the Holy Spirit, Whose Will is for God always.

<sup>4</sup>The power of our joint motivation is beyond belief, but not beyond accomplishment. 
<sup>5</sup>What we can accomplish together has no limits, because the Call for God is the Call to the unlimited. 
<sup>6</sup>Child of God, my message is for you, to hear and give away as you answer the Holy Spirit within you.
