1. To heal is to make happy. 
²I have told you to think how many opportunities you have had to gladden yourself, and how many you have refused. 
³This is the same as telling you that you have refused to heal yourself. 
⁴The light that belongs to you is the light of joy. 
⁵Radiance is not associated with sorrow. 
⁶Joy calls forth an integrated willingness to share it, and promotes the mind’s natural impulse to respond as one. 
⁷Those who attempt to heal without being wholly joyous themselves call forth different kinds of responses at the same time, and thus deprive others of the joy of responding wholeheartedly.

2. To be wholehearted you must be happy. 
²If fear and love cannot coëxist, and if it is impossible to be wholly fearful and remain alive, the only possible whole state is that of love. 
³There is no difference between love and joy. 
⁴Therefore, the only possible whole state is the wholly joyous. 
⁵To heal or to make joyous is therefore the same as to integrate and to make one. 
⁶That is why it makes no difference to what part or by what part of the Sonship the healing is offered. 
⁷Every part benefits, and benefits equally.

3. You are being blessed by every beneficent thought of any of your brothers anywhere. 
²You should want to bless them in return, out of gratitude. 
³You need not know them individually, or they you. 
⁴The light is so strong that it radiates throughout the Sonship and returns thanks to the Father for radiating His joy upon it. 
⁵Only God’s holy children are worthy channels of His beautiful joy, because only they are beautiful enough to hold it by sharing it. 
⁶It is impossible for a child of God to love his neighbor except as himself. 
⁷That is why the healer’s prayer is:
>⁸Let me know this brother as I know myself.
