		1.&emsp;Your distorted perceptions produce a dense cover over miracle impulses, making it hard for them to reach your own awareness. 
		<sup>2</sup>The confusion of miracle impulses with physical impulses is a major perceptual distortion. 
		<sup>3</sup>Physical impulses are misdirected miracle impulses. 
		<sup>4</sup>All real pleasure comes from doing God’s Will. 
		<sup>5</sup>This is because <em>not</em> doing it is a denial of Self. 
		<sup>6</sup>Denial of Self results in illusions, while correction of the error brings release from it. 
		<sup>7</sup>Do not deceive yourself into believing that you can relate in peace to God or to your brothers with anything external.

		2.&emsp;Child of God, you were created to create the good, the beautiful and the holy. 
		<sup>2</sup>Do not forget this. 
		<sup>3</sup>The Love of God, for a little while, must still be expressed through one body to another, because vision is still so dim. 
		<sup>4</sup>You can use your body best to help you enlarge your perception so you can achieve real vision, of which the physical eye is incapable. 
		<sup>5</sup>Learning to do this is the body’s only true usefulness.

		3.&emsp;Fantasy is a distorted form of vision. 
		<sup>2</sup>Fantasies of any kind are distortions, because they always involve twisting perception into unreality. 
		<sup>3</sup>Actions that stem from distortions are literally the reactions of those who know not what they do. 
		<sup>4</sup>Fantasy is an attempt to control reality according to false needs. 
		<sup>5</sup>Twist reality in any way and you are perceiving destructively. 
		<sup>6</sup>Fantasies are a means of making false associations and attempting to obtain pleasure from them. 
		<sup>7</sup>But although you can perceive false associations, you can never make them real except to yourself. 
		<sup>8</sup>You believe in what you make. 
		<sup>9</sup>If you offer miracles, you will be equally strong in your belief in them. 
		<sup>10</sup>The strength of your conviction will then sustain the belief of the miracle receiver. 
		<sup>11</sup>Fantasies become totally unnecessary as the wholly satisfying nature of reality becomes apparent to both giver and receiver. 
		<sup>12</sup>Reality is “lost” through usurpation, which produces tyranny. 
		<sup>13</sup>As long as a single “slave” remains to walk the earth, your release is not complete. 
		<sup>14</sup>Complete restoration of the Sonship is the only goal of the miracle-minded.

		4.&emsp;This is a course in mind training. 
		<sup>2</sup>All learning involves attention and study at some level. 
		<sup>3</sup>Some of the later parts of the course rest too heavily on these earlier sections not to require their careful study. 
		<sup>4</sup>You will also need them for preparation. 
		<sup>5</sup>Without this, you may become much too fearful of what is to come to make constructive use of it. 
		<sup>6</sup>However, as you study these earlier sections, you will begin to see some of the implications that will be amplified later on.

		5.&emsp;A solid foundation is necessary because of the confusion between fear and awe to which I have already referred, and which is often made. 
		<sup>2</sup>I have said that awe is inappropriate in connection with the Sons of God, because you should not experience awe in the presence of your equals. 
		<sup>3</sup>However, it was also emphasised that awe is proper in the Presence of your Creator. 
		<sup>4</sup>I have been careful to clarify my role in the Atonement without either over- or understating it. 
		<sup>5</sup>I am also trying to do the same with yours. 
		<sup>6</sup>I have stressed that awe is not an appropriate reaction to me because of our inherent equality. 
		<sup>7</sup>Some of the later steps in this course, however, involve a more direct approach to God Himself. 
		<sup>8</sup>It would be unwise to start on these steps without careful preparation, or awe will be confused with fear, and the experience will be more traumatic than beatific. 
		<sup>9</sup>Healing is of God in the end. 
		<sup>10</sup>The means are being carefully explained to you. 
		<sup>11</sup>Revelation may occasionally reveal the end to you, but to reach it the means are needed.

	<p class=simplified>We have an equal role in the Atonement. Awe and fear should not be confused. Fear is to be healed. Awe is proper towards God. Later steps in the course involve a direct approach to God.
