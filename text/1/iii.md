# T-1.III Atonement and Miracles

## T-1.III.1

<p class=fip id=p1>
1.&emsp;I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. 
<sup>2</sup>When you offer a miracle to any of my brothers, you do it to <em>yourself</em> and me. 
<sup>3</sup>The reason you come before me is that I do not need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you fail temporarily. 
<sup>4</sup>My part in the Atonement is the cancelling out of all errors that you could not otherwise correct. 
<sup>5</sup>When you have been restored to the recognition of your original state, you naturally become part of the Atonement yourself. 
<sup>6</sup>As you share my unwillingness to accept error in yourself and others, you must join the great crusade to correct it: listen to my voice, learn to undo error and act to correct it. 
<sup>7</sup>The power to work miracles belongs to you. 
<sup>8</sup>I will provide the opportunities to do them, but you must be ready and willing. 
<sup>9</sup>Doing them will bring conviction in the ability, because conviction comes through accomplishment. 
<sup>10</sup>The ability is the potential, the achievement is its expression, and the Atonement, which is the natural profession of the children of God, is the purpose.

#### simplified

I begin the process of Atonement. I helps you to cancel out errors. Atonement is being restored to your natural state. Correct error by listening to me. Learn to undo error and act to correct error. Be ready and willing to do miracles. Doing more miracles brings more conviction. Miracles are for Atonement.

#### commentary

In the Course, the Atonement as an event refers to the resurrection, not the crucifixion (C of A, p. 15.)

(1) Atonement corrects the error of separation, which holds that God was the victim of the Son’s attack, who them became the victim of his Father’s justified vengeance. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.189.)

(1) The life of Jesus was [an] “act of love”, for he was the “thought” within the separated mind that first remembered his relationship with God and Identity as Christ (along with the rest of the Sonship). He has been “placed” by the Holy Spirit as head of the overall plan, in charge of the Sonship and the Atonement. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.514.) c/f [T-1.III.4:1](#p4), [T-2.II.4:2–5](/text/2/ii#p4).

(1) When the Atonement is complete and the Sonship awakens from the dream, the Second Coming of Christ dawns. And Jesus is asking us to join in that process with him, which he “undertook to begin”. (Wapnick, AVI, p.228)

(1) This “appointment” of Jesus occurred on quite a different level since there is no time, and all of what we know as time is happening in this one instant, <em>now</em>, which we merely re-experience within our minds. (Wapnick, AAC, p.206.)

(1, 4) It is precisely his function of being in charge of the process of Atonement that we need (Wapnick, FAJ, p.293.)

## T.1.III.2

<p class=fip id=p2>
2.&emsp;“Heaven and earth shall pass away” means that they will not continue to exist as separate states. 
<sup>2</sup>My word, which is the resurrection and the life, shall not pass away because life is eternal. 
<sup>3</sup>You are the work of God, and His work is wholly lovable and wholly loving. 
<sup>4</sup>This is how a man must think of himself in his heart, because this is what he is.

#### commentary

(2) Rather than <em>Jesus</em> being the resurrection and the life, his <em>word</em>— his <em> teaching</em> — is. (C of A, p.20.)

(4) The Course reverses cause and effect. Instead of how you think of yourself dictating what you are, what you are needs to dictate how you think of yourself. (C of A, p.20.)

## T-1.III.3

<p class=fip id=p3>3.&emsp;The forgiven are the means of the Atonement. 
<sup>2</sup>Being filled with spirit, they forgive in return. 
<sup>3</sup>Those who are released must join in releasing their brothers, for this is the plan of the Atonement. 
<sup>4</sup>Miracles are the way in which minds that serve the Holy Spirit unite with me for the salvation or release of all of God’s creations.

## T-1.III.4

<p class=fip id=p4>
4.&emsp;I am the only one who can perform miracles indiscriminately, because I am the Atonement. 
<sup>2</sup>You have a role in the Atonement which I will dictate to you. 
<sup>3</sup>Ask me which miracles you should perform. 
<sup>4</sup>This spares you needless effort, because you will be acting under direct communication. 
<sup>5</sup>The impersonal nature of the miracle is an essential ingredient, because it enables me to direct its application, and under my guidance miracles lead to the highly personal experience of revelation. 
<sup>6</sup>A guide does not control but he does direct, leaving it up to you to follow. 
<sup>7</sup>“Lead us not into temptation” means “Recognise your errors and choose to abandon them by following my guidance”.

## T-1.III.5

5.&emsp;Error cannot really threaten truth, which can always withstand it. 
<sup>2</sup>Only the error is actually vulnerable. 
<sup>3</sup>You are free to establish your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is inevitable if you remember this:
<span class=course-quote>
<sup>4</sup>Spirit is in a state of grace forever.<br>
<sup>5</sup>Your reality is only spirit.<br>
<sup>6</sup>Therefore you are in a state of grace forever.<br>
</span>
<sup>7</sup>Atonement undoes all errors in this respect, and thus uproots the source of fear. 
<sup>8</sup>Whenever you experience God’s re-assurances as threat, it is always because you are defending misplaced or misdirected loyalty. 
<sup>9</sup>When you project this to others you imprison them, but only to the extent to which you re-inforce errors they have already made. 
<sup>10</sup>This makes them vulnerable to the distortions of others, since their own perception of themselves is distorted. 
<sup>11</sup>The miracle worker can only bless them, and this undoes their distortions and frees them from prison.

#### simplified

Error is vulnerable. Remember you are in a state of grace forever. Undoing errors uproots fear. Do not be loyal to error. Do not re-inforce or defend error. Bless others so they may undo their distortions.

#### commentary

(4–6) We live always in the grace of God’s freely given love. What Jesus taught during his earthly life is what he teaches now in the Course. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.216.)

9.&emsp;Miracles are selective only in the sense that they are directed towards those who can use them for themselves.
