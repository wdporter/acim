  <p class=fip>2.&emsp;The basic decision of the miracle-minded is not to wait on time any longer than is necessary. <sup>2</sup>Time can waste as well as be wasted. <sup>3</sup>The miracle worker, therefore, accepts the time-control factor gladly. <sup>4</sup>He recognises that every collapse of time brings everyone closer to the ultimate release from time, in which the Son and the Father are One. <sup>5</sup>Equality does not imply equality <em>now</em>. <sup>6</sup>When everyone recognises that he has everything, individual contributions to the Sonship will no longer be necessary.

  <p class=simplified>Collapse time by recognising you have everything. Every collapse brings everyone closer to knowledge of oneness.

  <p class=simplified>All are children of God. All are dependent on God. All share God’s gifts equally. All are special. Do not believe you are deprived of anything. Believing in deprivation distorts perceptions. Distorted perceptions create distorted relationships.
