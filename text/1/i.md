# T-1.I Principles of Miracles

## T-1.I.1

<p class=fip id=p1>
1.&emsp;There is no order of difficulty in miracles. <sup>2</sup>One is not “harder” or “bigger” than another. <sup>3</sup>They are all the same. <sup>4</sup>All expressions of love are maximal.
</p>

#### expanded

1.&emsp;There is no order of difficulty in miracles. 
<sup>2</sup>One [miracle] is not “harder” or “bigger” than another. 
<sup>3</sup>They [miracles] are all the same. 
<sup>4</sup>All expressions of love are maximal.

1.&emsp;There is no order of difficulty in miracles. 
<sup>2</sup>One miracle is not “harder” or “bigger” than another. 
<sup>3</sup>Miracles are all the same. 
<sup>4</sup>All expressions of love are maximal.

#### simplified

Miracles are all equal to do. Love always expresses as much as it can.

#### commentary

(1) In the vision of Heaven, there can be no gradations of illusions or mistakes. Something either is or it is not. … Truth is true; all else is only a mistake which, when brought to truth, is gently corrected, not judged against and punished. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 186).

(1) [It's] a simple plan for salvation that has no exceptions, [miracles] are all the same because there is likewise no hierarchy in illusions (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 562)

(1) The first principle of miracles … counteracts the ego’s first law of chaos “there is a hierarchy of illusions” (<a href="/text/23/ii#p2">T–23.II.2:3</a>). (Wapnick, AAC, p. 58.)

The very first principle of miracles that begins the text proper contains the whole thought system of the Course. In that sense the rest of the text is a commentary on this first principle which is the cornerstone of the teaching. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.15.)


## T-1.I.2

<p class=fip id=p2>
2.&emsp;Miracles as such do not matter. 
<sup>2</sup>The only thing that matters is their Source, which is far beyond evaluation.
</p>

#### expanded

<sup>2</sup>The only thing that matters is their [miracles’] Source, which is far beyond evaluation.

#### substituted

2.&emsp;Miracles as such do not matter. 
<sup>2</sup>The only thing that matters is miracles’ Source, which is far beyond evaluation.

#### simplified

The Source of a miracle matters more than the miracle. The Source of miracles is beyond evaluation.</p>

#### commentary

…likely… ‘source’ here refers to both God and love, or to God <em>as</em> love. (C of A, p.7)</p>

## T-1.I.3

<p class=fip id=p3>
3.&emsp;Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. 
<sup>2</sup>The real miracle is the love that inspires them. 
<sup>3</sup>In this sense everything that comes from love is a miracle.
</p>

#### substituted

3.&emsp;Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. 
<sup>2</sup>The real miracle is the love that inspires miracles. 
<sup>3</sup>Love inspires miracles, so everything that comes from love is a miracle.

#### simplified

Miracles are natural expressions of love. Love inspires miracles. Everything that comes from love is a miracle.

## T-1.I.4

<p class=fip id=p4>
4.&emsp;All miracles mean life, and God is the Giver of life. 
<sup>2</sup>His Voice will direct you very specifically. 
<sup>3</sup>You will be told all you need to know.
</p>

## T-1.I.5

<p class=fip id=p5>
5.&emsp;Miracles are habits, and should be involuntary. 
<sup>2</sup>They should not be under conscious control. 
<sup>3</sup>Consciously selected miracles can be misguided.

## T-1.I.6

<p class=fip id=p6>
6.&emsp;Miracles are natural. 
<sup>2</sup>When they do not occur something has gone wrong.
</p>

#### expanded

<sup>2</sup>When they [miracles] do not occur something has gone wrong.

#### substituted
6.&emsp;Miracles are natural. 
<sup>2</sup>When miracles do not occur something has gone wrong.

#### simplified
Something is wrong if a miracle does not happen.Miracles are natural.

#### commentary

… the world of separation [is] made real, along with the seemingly infinite range of problems to be solved. Hence, the first principle of miracles — there is no order of difficulty among them — seems impossible and beyond our attainment. It is the purpose of <em>A Course in Miracles</em> to teach us that it is not only possible, but perfectly natural (Wapnick, AVI, p.51.)

This statement reflects the very practical nature of the Course. It is not teaching us simply the intellectual concept that time is an illusionl; it is teaching us to recognise that all of our problems are the same. (Wapnick, AVI, p.51.)

## T-1.I.7

<p class=fip id=p7>
7.&emsp;Miracles are everyone’s right, but purification is necessary first.
</p>

#### expanded

7.&emsp;Miracles are everyone’s right, but purification is necessary first.

#### substituted

#### commentary

Purification is … of our thoughts (C of A, p.8.)

## T-1.I.8
<p class=fip id=p8>
8.&emsp;Miracles are healing because they supply a lack; they are performed by those who temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less.
</p>

#### expanded

8.&emsp;Miracles are healing because they [miracles] supply a lack; they [miracles] are performed by those who temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less.

#### substituted

8.&emsp;Miracles are healing because miracles supply a lack; miracles are performed by those who temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less.

#### simplified

Miracles supply a lack. Miracles are healing. Miracles come from those who have more. Miracles go to those who have less.

## T-1.I.9

<p class=fip id=p9>
9.&emsp;Miracles are a kind of exchange. 
<sup>2</sup>Like all expressions of love, which are always miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. 
<sup>3</sup>They bring more love both to the giver and the receiver.
</p>

#### expanded

9.&emsp;Miracles are a kind of exchange. 
<sup>2</sup>Like all expressions of love, which [expressions of love] are always miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws.

#### substituted

9.&emsp;Miracles are a kind of exchange. 
<sup>2</sup>Like all expressions of love — expressions of love are always miraculous in the true sense — the exchange reverses the physical laws. 
<sup>3</sup>Miracles bring more love both to the giver and the receiver.

#### simplified

Giving love ends up with more love for the giver. Increasing by giving is the true miracle. Most giving in the world results in less for the giver.

## T-1.I.10

<p class=fip id=p10>
10.&emsp;The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is a misunderstanding of their purpose.
</p>

#### expanded

The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is a misunderstanding of their [miracles’] purpose.

#### substituted

10.&emsp;The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is a misunderstanding of miracles’ purpose.

#### simplified

It is not the purpose of Miracles to induce belief.

#### commentary

…they must first <em>decide</em> to accept God’s word. Demanding an external sign as proof of God is really believing in magic, since we must instead choose the miracle that reflects ourinternal shift. … Thus Jesus taught elsewhere, “Why does this generation demand a sign? I tell you solemnly, no sign shall be given to this generation” (Mk 8:12). No sign will be given because it would not be the loving or helpful thing to do, re-inforcing, as it where, the belief in magic which ultimately re-inforces the belief in separation. (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 236–237.)

## T-1.I.11

<p class=fip id=p11>
11.&emsp;Prayer is the medium of miracles. 
<sup>2</sup>It is a means of communication of the created with the Creator. 
<sup>3</sup>Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love is expressed.
</p>

#### expanded

<sup>2</sup>Prayer is a means of communication of the created with the Creator. 
<sup>3</sup>Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love is expressed.

#### simplified

Communication with God is through prayer. Love is received from prayer. Love is expressed by miracles.



## T-1.I.12

<p class=fip id=p12>
12.&emsp;Miracles are thoughts. 
<sup>2</sup>Thoughts can represent the lower or bodily level of experience, or the higher or spiritual level of experience. 
<sup>3</sup>One makes the physical, and the other creates the spiritual.
</p>

#### expanded

12.&emsp;Miracles are thoughts. 
<sup>2</sup>Thoughts can represent the lower or bodily level of experience, or the higher or spiritual level of experience. 
<sup>3</sup>One [the lower level of experience] makes the physical, and the other [spiritual level of experience] creates the spiritual.

#### substituted

12.&emsp;Miracles are thoughts. 
<sup>2</sup>Thoughts can represent the lower or bodily level of experience, or the higher or spiritual level of experience. 
<sup>3</sup>The lower level of experience makes the physical, and the the higher level of experience creates the spiritual.

#### simplified

Miracles are thoughts. Thoughts can represent a bodily level of experience and make the physical. Thoughts can represent a spiritual level of experience and make the spiritual.

#### commentary

Jesus clearly delineates the mutually exclusive nature of the levels of the mind and the body, and cautions his students against confusing them. Such confusion… is what is responsible for sickness. And it is the miracle that heals by redirecting the Son’s attention to the proper level — the mind instead of the body — wherein is found both the problem and the answser. Here are the relevant level-confusion passages (also principles 17, 23, 30) that highlights the dimension of the miracle or healing (the mind) and sickness (the body) (Wapnick AAC p.230–231)


## T-1.I.13

<p class=fip id=p13>
13.&emsp;Miracles are both beginnings and endings, and so they alter the temporal order. 
<sup>2</sup>They are always affirmations of rebirth, which seem to go back but really go forward. 
<sup>3</sup>They undo the past in the present, and thus release the future.

<sup>2</sup>Miracles are always affirmations of rebirth, which seem to go back but really go forward. 
<sup>3</sup>Miracles undo the past in the present, and thus release the future.

#### simplified

Miracles change time by changing beginnings and endings. Miracles allow rebirth. A rebirth does not change the past. A rebirth brings past and future into the present.

#### commentary

…the miracle reflects the change of mind that enables us to let go of our guilt, the belief in our past sinfulness. This then frees the Holy Spritit to work through us in the sense that we are now allowing the extension of His Love to occur. In the words of <a href=/w/p1/194>Lesson 194</a>: “I place the future in the hands of God”. This is not possible as long as we hold on to the ego’s guilt. It <em>is</em> possible, of course, when we let go of the guilt, and that is what releases the future. The “beginning and the ending” that is referred to can be understood [sic] as the beginning and the ending of a relationship. The “beginning” would be the special relationnship that the ego has made real, while the “ending” is the forgiveness of that relationship — making it holy. (Wapnick, AVI, p. 123.)

## T-1.I.14

<p class=fip id=p14>
14.&emsp;Miracles bear witness to truth. 
<sup>2</sup>They are convincing because they arise from conviction. 
<sup>3</sup>Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive; or rather, the uncreative use of mind.
</p>

<sup>3</sup>Without conviction miracles deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive; or rather, the uncreative use of mind.

#### simplified

Miracles are a convincing witness to truth. Without conviction miracles are only magic. Magic is mindless. Magic is uncreative use of mind.


## T-1.I.15

<p class=fip id=p15>
15.&emsp;Each day should be devoted to miracles. 
<sup>2</sup>The purpose of time is to enable you to learn how to use time constructively. 
<sup>3</sup>It is thus a teaching device and a means to an end. 
<sup>4</sup>Time will cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating learning.

<sup>4</sup>Time will cease when time is no longer useful in facilitating learning.

#### simplified

Each day should be devoted to miracles. Use time to teach and learn miracles. Time will end when learning ends.

#### commentary

(2–4) …the course urges us to look at the world benevolently: since we believe we are here, the world can be seen as kind, offering us iteself as a classroom in which we learn the lessons that will lead us beyond the world entirely … These lines echo the spirit of Origen, for whom the world was also a classroom. (Wapnick, LDNC p. 575–6.)

The point here is that the ego made time as a way of trapping us, re-inforcing our belief that separation and guilt are real, and so our fear of punishment is justified. The Holy Spirit, though, uses time in His own way within the illusion, so that He teaches us something else.  (Wapnick, AVI, p. 123–124.)

Time is used by the Holy Spirit as a “teaching device” not because it is real, but because it is a means whereby we can learn. When we have learned our lessons time will disappear. As time was not made by God, it is not eternal, lasting only as long as the dream that gave rise to it is accorded reality.  (Wapnick, AVI, p. 125.)


## T-1.I.16

<p class=fip id=p16>
16.&emsp;Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating it is as blessed to give as to receive. 
<sup>2</sup>They simultaneously increase the strength of the giver and supply strength to the receiver.

#### commentary

(1) What we give <em>is</em> what we receive; what we ask for <em>is</em> our return. … As the beatitude says: “Happy the merciful, they shall have mercy shown them” (Mt. 5:7). (Wapnick, FAJ, p. 176.)


## T-1.I.17

#### commentary

You love your neighbour as yourself by recognising the ‘inestimable’ value in both. (C of A, p.10.)

## T-1.I.19

<p class=fip id=p19>
19.&emsp;Miracles make minds one in God. 
<sup>2</sup>They depend on co-operation because the Sonship is the sum of all that God created.

The body is not the altar of truth. Miracles heal by making you aware that the spirit is the altar of truth.

#### commentary

It is only when we choose the miracle, and can say and truly believe that “I am under no law’s but God’s” (W-p1.76) that the effects of the ego’s laws disappear. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.77.)
