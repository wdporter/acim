  <p class=fip>1.&emsp;Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear. <sup>2</sup>It reflects the original form of communication between God and His creations, involving the extremely personal sense of creation sometimes sought in physical relationships. <sup>3</sup>Physical closeness cannot achieve it. <sup>4</sup>Miracles, however, are genuinely interpersonal, and result in true closeness to others. <sup>5</sup>Revelation unites you directly with God. <sup>6</sup>Miracles unite you directly with your brother. <sup>7</sup>Neither emanates from consciousness, but both are experienced there. <sup>8</sup>Consciousness is the state that induces action, though it does not inspire it. <sup>9</sup>You are free to believe what you choose, and what you do attests to what you believe.</p>

  <p class=simplified>Miracles unite you with your brother. Revelation unites you with God. Revelation is the original communication with God. There is no doubt or fear in revelation. In revelation you understand creation. You act according our beliefs.</p>

  <p class=fip>2.&emsp;Revelation is intensely personal and cannot be meaningfully translated. <sup>2</sup>That is why any attempt to describe it in words is impossible. <sup>3</sup>Revelation induces only experience. <sup>4</sup>Miracles, on the other hand, induce action. <sup>5</sup>They are more useful now because of their interpersonal nature. <sup>6</sup>In this phase of learning, working miracles is important because freedom from fear cannot be thrust upon you. <sup>7</sup>Revelation is literally unspeakable because it is an experience of unspeakable love.</p>

  <p class=simplified>Revelation is an experience of love and freedom from fear. Revelation cannot be spoken about. Miracles are useful actions for others, until you are ready for revelation.</p>

    <p class=fip>3.&emsp;Awe should be reserved for revelation, to which it is perfectly and correctly applicable. <sup>2</sup>It is not appropriate for miracles because a state of awe is worshipful, implying that one of a lesser order stands before his Creator. <sup>3</sup>You are a perfect creation, and should experience awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection. <sup>4</sup>The miracle is therefore a sign of love among equals. <sup>5</sup>Equals should not be in awe of one another because awe implies inequality. <sup>6</sup>It is therefore an inappropriate reaction to me. <sup>7</sup>An elder brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience, and obedience for his greater wisdom. <sup>8</sup>He is also entitled to love because he is a brother, and to devotion if he is devoted. <sup>9</sup>It is only my devotion that entitles me to yours. <sup>10</sup>There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. <sup>11</sup>I have nothing that does not come from God. <sup>12</sup>The difference between us now is that I have nothing else. <sup>13</sup>This leaves me in a state which is only potential in you.</p>

    <p class=simplified>Awe is for revelation. Miracles are for others. Love, respect, obedience, devotion are due an elder brother. Jesus has only what is from God. You have the potential to be like Jesus. </p>
    <p class=commentary>[Jesus], our loving elder brother. (Wapnick, AAC, p. 197)</p>
    <p class=commentary>Jesus consistently teaches in the course that he is no different from us in reality, but in the illusory and symbolic world of time he can be our teacher and guide if we allow him to be that for us. (Wapnick, AAC, p. 214)</p>
    <p class=commentary>Jesus is unlike us in having no ego thoughts of separation — guilt, fear or attack — to cloud his mind of the clear light of Christ. (Wapnick, LDNC, p. 517, 518)</p>

  <p class=fip>4.&emsp;“No man comes unto the Father but by me” does not mean that I am in any way separate or different from you except in time, and time does not really exist. <sup>2</sup>The statement is more meaningful in terms of a vertical rather than a horizontal axis. <sup>3</sup>You stand below me and I stand below God. <sup>4</sup>In the process of ‘rising up’, I am higher because without me the distance between God and man would be too great for you to encompass. <sup>5</sup>I bridge the distance as an elder brother to you on the one hand, and as a Son of God on the other. <sup>6</sup>My devotion to my brothers has placed me in charge of the Sonship, which I render complete because I share it. <sup>7</sup>This may appear to contradict the statement “I and my Father are one”, but there are two parts to the statement in recognition that the Father is greater.</p>

  <p class=simplified>Jesus stands between you and God. Jesus bridges the distance between you and God. Jesus is your elder brother and Son of God. The Father is greater than the Son.</p>
  <p class=commentary>[Jesus] is not “in any way separate or different” from us except in the world of time (Wapnick, LDNC, p.449).</p>
  <p class=commentary>This statement (viz 6) may mean that he can only bring the Sonship back to completion if he himself shares the quality of “Sonship” with everyone (C of A, p.42).</p>

    <p class=fip>6.&emsp;The miracle minimises the need for time. <sup>2</sup>In the longitudinal or horizontal plane the recognition of the equality of the members of the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time. <sup>3</sup>However, the miracle entails a sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception. <sup>4</sup>This introduces an interval from which the giver and receiver both emerge farther along in time than they would otherwise have been. <sup>5</sup>The miracle thus has the unique property of abolishing time to the extent that it renders the interval of time it spans unnecessary. <sup>6</sup>There is no relationship between the time a miracle takes and the time it covers. <sup>7</sup>The miracle substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands of years. <sup>8</sup>It does so by the underlying recognition of perfect equality of giver and receiver on which the miracle rests. <sup>9</sup>The miracle shortens time by collapsing it, thus eliminating certain intervals within it. <sup>10</sup>It does this, however, within the larger temporal sequence.</p>
