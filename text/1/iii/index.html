	<p class=substituted>1.&emsp;I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. <sup>2</sup>When you offer a miracle to any of my brothers, you offer a miracle to <em>yourself</em> and me. <sup>3</sup>The reason you come before me is that I do not need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you fail temporarily. <sup>4</sup>My part in the Atonement is the cancelling out of all errors that you could not otherwise correct. <sup>5</sup>When you have been restored to the recognition of your original state, you naturally become part of the Atonement yourself. <sup>6</sup>As you share my unwillingness to accept error in yourself and others, you must join the great crusade to correct error; listen to my voice, learn to undo error and act to correct error. <sup>7</sup>The power to work miracles belongs to you. <sup>8</sup>I will provide the opportunities to do miracles, but you must be ready and willing. <sup>9</sup>Doing miracles will bring conviction in the ability to do miracles, because conviction comes through accomplishment. <sup>10</sup>The ability to do miracles is the potential, the achievement of miracles is the potential’s expression, and the Atonement, which is the natural profession of the children of God, is the purpose.</p>
	
	<p class=simplified>Jesus begins the process of Atonement. Jesus helps us to cancel out errors. Atonement is being restored to your natural state. Correct error by listening to Jesus. Learn to undo error and act to correct error. Be ready and willing to do miracles. Doing more miracles brings more conviction. Miracles are for Atonement.</p>
	
	<p class=simplified>In the Course, the Atonement as an event refers to the resurrection, not the crucifixion (C of A, p. 15.)
	
	<p class=commentary>Atonement corrects the error of separation, which holds that God was the victim of the Son’s attack, who them became the victim of his Father’s justified vengeance. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.189.) </p>
	
	<p class=commentary>It is precisely his function of being in charge of the process of Atonement that we need (Wapnick, FAJ, p.293.)
	
	<p class=commentary>The life of Jesus was [an] “act of love”, for he was the “thought” within the separated mind that first remembered his relationship with God and Identity as Christ (along with the rest of the Sonship). He has been “placed” by the Holy Spirit as head of the overall plan, in charge of the Sonship and the Atonement. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.514.) c/f <a href="#t-1.iii.4">T-1.III.4:1</a>, <a href="/text/2/ii#t-2.ii.4">T-2.II.4:2–5</a>.
	
	<p class=commentary>This “appointment” of Jesus occurred on quite a different level since there is no time, and all of what we know as time is happening in this one instant, <em>now</em>, which we merely re-experience within our minds. (Wapnick, AAC, p.206.)

  <p class=commentary>Rather than <em>Jesus</em> being the resurrection and the life, his <em>word</em>— his <em> teaching</em> — is. (CofA, p.20.)</p>
  <p class=commentary>The Course reverses cause and effect. Instead of how you think of yourself dictating what you are, what you are needs to dictate how you think of yourself. (CofA, p.20.)</p>

	<p class=simplified>Error is vulnerable. Remember you are in a state of grace forever. Undoing errors uproots fear. Do not be loyal to error. Do not re-inforce or defend error. Bless others to undo their distortions.</p>

	<p class=commentary>We live always in the grace of God’s freely given love. What Jesus taught during his earthly life is what he teaches now in the Course. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.216.)
