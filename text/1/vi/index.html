		1.&emsp;You who want peace can find it only by complete forgiveness. 
		<sup>2</sup>No learning is acquired by anyone unless he wants to learn it and believes in some way that he needs it. 
		<sup>3</sup>While lack does not exist in the creation of God, it is very apparent in what you have made. 
		<sup>4</sup>It is, in fact, the essential difference between them. 
		<sup>5</sup>Lack implies that you would be better off in a state somehow different from the one you are in. 
		<sup>6</sup>Until the “separation”, which is the meaning of the “fall”, nothing was lacking. 
		<sup>7</sup>There were no needs at all. 
		<sup>8</sup>Needs arise only when you deprive yourself. 
		<sup>9</sup>You act according to the particular order of needs you establish. 
		<sup>10</sup>This, in turn, depends on your perception of what you are.

	<p class=simplified>God’s creations have no lack. You deprived yourself by separating from God. Forgive yourself and see yourself truly. 
	
	<p class=commentary>The ego counsels us … to cannabalise what is outside of us, wresting it from another (or the world) and incorporating it within ourselves to fill the gaping hole of nothingness the ego has convinced us is our reality. Thus the orienting premise of the ego is the … scarcity principle: that we are missing something within, a lack that has its origin in the separation from God. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.488.; c/f AAC, p.123.)

		<sup>2</sup>This sense of separation would never have arisen if you had not distorted your perception of truth, and had thus perceived yourself as lacking. 
		<sup>3</sup>The idea of order of needs arose because, having made this fundamental error, you had already fragmented yourself into levels with different needs.

		<sup>5</sup>Unified needs lead to unified action, because this produces a lack of conflict.

		<p class=simplified>You perceived yourself as lacking. You felt separated from God. You became fragmented by believing in different needs. Act only to restore oneness with God. God is all you need. 
	
		<p class=commentary>You only need God, but the moment you see yourself as lacking something, <em>anything</em>, a sense of separation from God is introduced. This is the error to be undone (Ed.).

		3.&emsp;The idea of orders of need, which follows from the original error that one can be separated from God, requires correction at its own level before the error of perceiving levels at all can be corrected. 
		<sup>2</sup>You cannot behave effectively while you function on different levels. 
		<sup>3</sup>However, while you do, correction must be introduced vertically from the bottom up. 
		<sup>4</sup>This is because you think you live in space, where concepts such as “up” and “down” are meaningful. 
		<sup>5</sup>Ultimately, space is as meaningless as time. 
		<sup>6</sup>Both are merely beliefs.

	<p class=simplified>Correct the belief that you need something in the world of space and time. Then you an correct the error of separation.

	<p class=commentary>The course urges us to look at the world benevolently: since we believe we are here, the world can be seen as kind, offering us itself as a classroom in which we learn the lessons that will lead us beyond the world entirely. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.575–576.)
